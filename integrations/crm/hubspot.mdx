<Info>
**PREMIUM ADD-ON** ✨

This integration is only available to users with a specific paying add-on. Please
**[contact us](mailto:hello@getlago.com)** to get access to HubSpot CRM integration.
</Info>

<Warning>

    This integration is a one-way sync, where Lago continuously syncs billing data to HubSpot in real time.
    Currently, it doesn’t support fetching information or taking actions from HubSpot back to Lago.

</Warning>

## Object mapping

<Info>
    As Lago needs to sync billing data to HubSpot custom objects, your HubSpot account needs to be on the **Sales Hub Enterprise** plan.

</Frame>

To fully integrate Lago with HubSpot, start by connecting your Lago instance to a new HubSpot connection. You can have an unlimited number of HubSpot connections. First, link your HubSpot account to Lago. Once connected, activate the specific syncs and actions required for your use case. This ensures that your Lago instance is properly configured to communicate with HubSpot, enabling seamless data synchronization and management.

1. In Lago, navigate to **Integrations** > **HubSpot**;
2. Create a **new HubSpot connection**;
3. Assign a unique **name** and **code** to the connection;
4. Select the **default targeted object** for Lago customers between HubSpot Contacts or Companies; and
5. Use OAuth2 to grant access to the desired HubSpot account.

There you go, Lago is fully connected to HubSpot!
