### Establish and finalize connection
<Frame caption="Connect your Lago instance to Salesforce Lago App">
  <img src="/integrations/data/images/salesforce-package-api-connection.gif" />
</Frame>

**Option 1: Configure a standard API Base URL**
To establish a connection between your Lago instance and the Salesforce Package, follow these steps:

1. Access Salesforce and locate the **App Launcher**;
2. Find and open the Lago app you recently installed;
3. Within the Lago Base Configuration tab:
  - Provide your **Lago API Key** (located in Lago's Developer Section)
  - Enter your Lago **API base URL**. Do not insert the `api/v1` at the end of the URL. By default, the valid URL is `https://api.getlago.com/`. 
  If you want to change the API base URL to another one (e.g., `https://api.eu.getlago.com/` or a custom self-hosted one), please follow option 2.
  - Enter lago app URL (**Front End Base URL**). By default, the valid URL is `https://app.getlago.com/` (it will be different for self-hosted).
  - Enter Lago Integration code from Step 1 [`Salesforce integration on Lago`](/integrations/crm/salesforce-crm#create-integration-for-salesforce-on-lago-side)
4. **"Save and validate"** your connection; and
  - If the **Lago API Key** is valid then only **Start Data Sync** button will be enabled.
5. Click the **"Start Data Sync"** to finalize the connection between Lago and Salesforce.

<Warning>
Please note that data synchronization is available only for Lago customers with an `external_salesforce_id` and an existing Salesforce Account.
</Warning>

**Option 2: Configure a custom API Base URL**
If you use your own Lago API base URL (self-hosting) or one for a different server instance, 
you can customize it directly in Salesforce: 
1. Navigate to Salesforce's Setup;
2. Search for and select Remote Site Settings;
3. Find and access the remote site for the Lago App;
4. Click the Edit button to modify the remote site's details;
5. Update the Remote Site URL with your preferred URL; and
6. Save the changes.

## II. Sync data from Lago to Salesforce
If your webhook endpoint is configured correctly, your *customer, subbscription, and billing data will flow seamlessly in real-time**.

<Info>
Please note that from all the version above Salesforce for Lago v2.7 - Customer, Subscriptions, and Invoices will be created in Salesforce via webhooks seamlessly
</Info>

### Sync customers to Salesforce (> v2.7)
<Info>
For organizations with existing Lago customers that need to be synchronized with Salesforce, our support team provides specialized assistance with the migration process. Please contact our team to initiate this synchronization.
</Info>

To establish a new customer connection between Lago and Salesforce, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the customer creation screen in Lago
2. Complete the standard customer information fields
3. Expand the 'Connect to external apps' section at the bottom of the form
4. Select Salesforce and choose the integration established during the initial setup
5. Choose the appropriate synchronization method:

- For existing Salesforce customers: Enter the corresponding 'Salesforce Account ID'


<Frame caption="Customer external apps connection interface">
  <img src="/integrations/data/images/lago-connect-customer-external-apps.gif" />
</Frame>

<Info>
The system handles account creation in Salesforce based on your configuration:

For Salesforce instances with Person Accounts enabled:

When `Customer Type` is set to `Individual1: Creates a Person Record type account.

When `Customer Type` is `Company` or unspecified: Creates a standard company account using the default record type for the running user

For Salesforce instances without Person Accounts:
Creates all accounts using the default record type associated with the running user
</Info>


<Warning>
Important considerations for customer record management:

Synchronized customer records have specific update restrictions in Salesforce to maintain data integrity

When using the Lago Integration Code (available for >= v2.7):

The system sets `sync_with_provider` to `true`.
This setting allows future updates from lago in Salesforce. 


Without the Lago Integration Code (for < v2.7):

We don't keep the data in sync from lago to Salesforce. Only initial sync is avaialble from lago to Salesforce, check below section.

</Warning>


### Sync customers to Salesforce (< v2.7)
To synchronize Lago Customer data with Salesforce Accounts (native object), ensure that your 
Salesforce Account is created first, and that the Lago Customer's `external_salesforce_id` is explicitly populated.

1. Begin by creating a new Account in Salesforce or accessing an existing one;
2. Next, create a customer in Lago and populate the `external_salesforce_id` field for a Lago Customer with the Salesforce Account Id; and
3. Finally, your Salesforce Account and Lago Customer are synchronized!

<Warning>
Billing data will not sync unless these requirements are met. 
Lago does not create Salesforce Accounts.
Before syncing billing data, you need to create or retrieve an existing Account in Salesforce 
and populate the Lago customer field called `external_salesforce_id`.
</Warning>

<Frame caption="Salesforce Account with Lago Customer information">

### Sync subscriptions to Salesforce

<Frame caption="Sync subscriptions data from Lago to Salesforce">
  <img src="/integrations/data/images/sync-lago-subscriptions-salesforce.gif" />
</Frame>

Whenever a subscription is created for a Lago Customer, the subscription details will be automatically 
synced in real-time with Salesforce using the `Lago Subscriptions` custom object.

Here is a list of Subscription fields that are automatically synced. 
Note that this subcription is automatically linked to a Salesforce Account:

- Subscription Id;
- Subscription Name;
- Subscription Start Date;
- Subscription Status;

  - Applied coupons are synced to `Lago Applied Coupon` custom object. 

### Schedule Sync from Lago To Salesforce
We also provide option to schedule the data sync from Lago to Salesforce. 
  - `LagoSyncScheduleable` -- a schedulable class which helps us schedule either all the data or any one of them.
  - To schedule the sync of any _ONE_ of the object:
    - Create a new instance of class by passing any one of the following string: `CUSTOMER`, `SUBSCRIPTION`, `PLAN`, `ADDON`, `INVOICE`, `CREDITNOTE`
      - Ex: To sync Plans from lago to Salesforce everyday at 1PM, execute below anonymous code in Anonymous window in Developer Console. ([click here to learn more about CRON expression](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_scheduler.htm))
        ```
        //Create a new instance. Pass 'PLAN' in brackets.
        lago.LagoSyncScheduleable syncPlan = new lago.LagoSyncScheduleable('PLAN');
        //CRON expression to schedule a job everyday at 1 PM
        String schedule_cron = '0 0 13 * * ?';
        //schedule(name, cron_expression, class_instance)
        System.schedule('Sync Lago Plan', schedule_cron, syncPlan);
        ```
  - To schedule the sync of  _ALL_ the objects:
    - create a new instance of class by passing `true`
      - Ex: To sync **all** objects from lago to Salesforce everyday at 1PM, execute below anonymous code in Anonymous window in Developer Console. ([click here to learn more about CRON expression](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_scheduler.htm))
        ```
        //Create a new instance. Pass true in brackets.
        lago.LagoSyncScheduleable syncAll = new lago.LagoSyncScheduleable(true);
        //CRON expression to schedule a job everyday at 1 PM
        String schedule_cron = '0 0 13 * * ?';
        //schedule(name, cron_expression, class_instance)
        System.schedule('Sync Lago all', schedule_cron, syncAll);
        ```


## III. Actions from Salesforce to Lago
Beyond just syncing data from Lago to Salesforce, you can also initiate actions in Lago directly from Salesforce. 
You can leverage Salesforce `Flows` to execute actions in Lago. Lago provides several customizable templates for creating customers from Salesforce Accounts, directly assigning subscriptions to customers from Salesforce, creating one-off invoice from salesforce.

### Create customers
#### Flow: `Lago Template - Create Customer in Lago on Account Create`
<Frame caption="Use Lago template to create a customer on Account creation">
  <img src="/integrations/images/lago-salesforce-flows-tempate.png" />
</Frame>


To create a customer in Lago upon the creation of a Salesforce Account, utilize the Flow template provided by Lago.

1. Log into your Salesforce instance;
2. Access the Setup section via the settings wheel icon in Salesforce;
3. Find and select `Flows` under Process Automation in the sidebar;
4. Locate and open the `Lago Template - Create Customer in Lago on Account Create`;
5. Click 'Save As' to create and save your own version of the template; and
6. Do not forget to click the `Activate` button to activate your flow. 

You have the **flexibility to modify various aspects of this flow, including the trigger conditions and field mappings**. 
By default, the action is initiated when a Lago ID is absent. Additionally, you can customize how fields are mapped from your Salesforce instance to Lago. You can also configure `customer type` to 'Individual' or 'Company' which creating customer from Salesforce to Lago.

<Frame caption="Customize the flow">
  <img src="/integrations/images/account-customer-flow.gif" />
</Frame>


### Create subscriptions (automation)

Assigning a plan to a customer, adjusting negotiated prices, and initiating the subscription upon winning an opportunity represents a key action from Salesforce to Lago. 
This enables sales teams to remain within Salesforce, their primary tool, and activate billing processes directly, without the need to switch platforms.

To assign a subscription and set prices in Lago directly from Salesforce, use the provided two flows via following Lago Flow templates.

#### Flow 1: `Lago Template - Create Lago SObject Records`

This Flow is used to create intermediate records in Lago Objects - `Lago Subscription`

1. Log into your Salesforce instance;
2. Access the Setup section via the settings gear icon in Salesforce;
3. Find and select `Flows` under Process Automation in the sidebar;
4. Locate and open the `Lago Template - Create Lago SObject Records`;
5. Click 'Save As' to create and save your own version of the template; and
6. Do not forget to click the `Activate` button to activate your flow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Validate the flow">
    The default setting triggers plan assignment when a Salesforce Account links to a Lago customer and the **opportunity status changes to closed-won**. 
    You can customize this flow to suit your specific needs. Moreover, you have the option to adjust the subscription fields and subscription charges fields being synchronized from Salesforce to Lago.
    <Frame caption="Customize the flow">
      <img src="/integrations/images/sync-subscriptions-salesforce-lago-flow.gif" />
    </Frame>
  
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign subscription and override prices">
    1. Create an opportunity by assigning an expected closed date and a stage;
    2. Add a Lago plan to this opportunity **as a product** (Salesforce will automatically retrieve all plans from Lago in `Standard Price Book`);
    3. Specify `1` for the quantity of the plan;
    4. Use the custom UI to either assign this plan directly or to override prices; and
    5. Click on 'Lago Override Plan' to finalize the subscription assignment.

    <Info>
      By default, the lago subscription record in salesforce is created when the opportunity is `closed-won`. You can assign multiple subscriptions for the same opportunity.
    </Info>

  </Step>

### Managing Coupons in Salesforce
The Salesforce integration allows you to manage customer coupons directly from your Salesforce interface. This section explains how to apply new coupons to customer accounts and manage existing coupons effectively.

#### Applying Coupons to Accounts

Before you begin applying coupons, you'll need to ensure your Salesforce environment is properly configured. The "Apply Coupon" action button must be available in your account page layout or lightning record page. If you don't see this button, work with your Salesforce administrator to add it through the page layout editor or lightning app builder.
Once your environment is configured, follow these steps to apply a coupon to a customer account:

1. Navigate to the Account Details> Access the account details page for the customer who will receive the coupon.
2. Initiate Coupon Application > Click the "Apply Coupon" action button. This will open a popup dialog for coupon configuration.
3. Select and Configure the Coupon. The configuration options will vary depending on the type of coupon you're applying:
  - For Fixed Amount Coupons: Enter the discount amount, select the appropriate currency, Choose the frequency for applied coupon
  <Info>
  If the Lago customer currency is already set in the account, the currency field will be locked to maintain consistency.
  </Info>
    - For recurring frequencies, specify the duration period

  - For Percentage-Based Coupons: Verify or adjust the percentage rate, set the frequency of application
    - For recurring frequencies, enter the duration period


4. Complete the Application
  - Click the "Apply Coupon" button to finalize the process. 
  - This action will: 
    - Create an Applied Coupon record in Salesforce
    - Synchronize the coupon with the customer's account in Lago
    - Enable the discount for future qualifying transactions

  <Frame caption="Apply Coupon on Accoun">
      <img src="/integrations/data/images/sf-apply-coupon.gif" />
  </Frame>

#### Terminating Active Coupons
There may be times when you need to end a coupon's application before its natural expiration. Here's how to terminate an active coupon:

1. Access the Coupon Record. Navigate to the Applied Coupon details page for the coupon you wish to terminate.
2. Initiate Termination, locate the "Terminate Coupon" checkbox in the record.
3. Confirm Termination: Check the box to initiate the termination process. Upon saving:
  - The coupon status will update from "Active" to "Terminated"
  - The change will synchronize with Lago
  - The customer will no longer receive the discount


<Warning>
Remember that coupon termination is permanent. Once a coupon is terminated, it cannot be reactivated. You would need to apply a new coupon if the discount needs to be reinstated.
</Warning>
This coupon management system ensures that your sales team can efficiently handle discounts and promotional offers while maintaining synchronization between Salesforce and Lago platforms.


## Debugging & logs

To ensure seamless data synchronization between Lago and Salesforce, every action and data transfer is meticulously logged. 
These logs are accessible directly through the Lago package for comprehensive debugging and analysis:

1. Navigate to 'Lago Base Configuration': This is your starting point for accessing the debugging tools. and
2. Access Logs: Click on the 'Logs' tab to view a detailed record of all activities.

You can refresh logs to keep your data current or delete unnecessary logs to maintain clarity and efficiency in the debugging process.
This approach aids in promptly identifying and resolving integration issues.
