## Overview

Lago's native integration with Avatax simplifies tax calculation and reporting by syncing invoice amounts with Avatax for filing.

When an invoice is in draft status, Lago creates a Sales Order in Avatax to calculate the preliminary taxes. Once the invoice is finalized, Lago creates a permanent transaction as a Sales Invoice in Avatax to calculate the final taxes, marking it for reporting to the appropriate tax authority via Avatax.

To calculate the appropriate tax for each line item, Lago sends the billing entity's address, customer’s address, tax identifier (if applicable), and the relevant tax code to Avatax. 
Avatax then calculates the tax for the invoice and returns the data to Lago, which is used to update the invoice with accurate tax information. Additionally, Lago synchronizes updates for voided and disputed invoices, as well as any credit notes created, ensuring that your records remain up to date.
