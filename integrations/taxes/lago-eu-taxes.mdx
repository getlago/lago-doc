Lago now features an automatic European tax detection integration for your customers.

## Enable Lago's EU Tax integration
Activate Lago's automatic EU tax detection in just a few steps:

1. Navigate to your Lago instance **Settings**;
2. Select the **'Lago EU Tax Management'** integration;
3. Enter or confirm your organization's country; and
4. Hit **'Connect'** to activate this integration.

## Automated EU tax rates detection
When you connect the Lago EU Tax Management integration, it automatically generates a list of standard European tax rates. 
These rates, labeled as `automated` in Lago, are synchronized with the latest standard tax rates for European countries, 
ensuring your tax calculations are always up-to-date and compliant.

Each tax rate begins with the `lago_` prefix, ensuring a uniform and easily identifiable format across your tax rate list.
This systematic approach simplifies the management and recognition of these automated tax entries within your system.

Before applying standard B2B/B2C rules, Lago checks the customer's **postal code** to detect EU special territories — regions that are outside EU VAT territory or have reduced rates despite belonging to an EU member state. If a match is found, the territory-specific rate is applied and VIES validation is skipped.

If no special territory is detected, Lago's next step involves verifying if a customer has a `tax_identification_number`. This check occurs whenever a customer's profile is created or updated, ensuring that the most current tax-related information is used in subsequent processes.

## Special territory detection

When a customer has a `zipcode` set, Lago matches it against known special territory postal code patterns. If matched, the standard country rate is overridden with the territory's exception rate.

<Warning>
  Make sure to set the **zipcode** on your customer profile. Without a postal code, Lago falls back to the standard country rate and special territory detection is skipped.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **France DOM-TOM exception:** For French overseas territories (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, Réunion, Mayotte), the exception rate only applies to **B2B customers** (those with a `tax_identification_number`). B2C customers in these territories are charged the standard French rate of 20%, in line with French tax law (CGI Articles 294–296).
</Info>

### B2B tax decision process
When a `tax_identification_number` is identified on a customer profile, Lago conducts a real-time verification 
using the [EU's VAT Information Exchange System (VIES)](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/#/vat-validation) to 
confirm the existence of the company. 

**In case the VIES check matches a valid company:**

1. If the customer's company is registered in the same country as your organization, Lago applies the customer 
country's tax rate;
2. If the customer's company is registered in the same country as your organization, but there is a tax exception for a particular zipcode, Lago applies the tax exception of this specific zipcode; or
3. If the customer's company is registered in a different country than your organization, Lago implements a 
**reverse charge** mechanism, applying a 0% tax rate.

### B2C tax decision process
If the VIES check does not confirm an active company or if no `tax_identification_number` is provided, 
Lago then assesses the `country` associated with your customer. Based on this:

1. If your customer's `country` is unspecified, Lago defaults to applying your organization's country tax rate; or
2. If your customer's `country` is within the European Union, Lago applies the tax rate corresponding your customer's EU country; or
3. If your customer's `country` is outside the European Union, Lago applies a **tax exempt** rate at 0%.


## Guidelines for VIES checks by Lago
Lago performs VIES verifications under these circumstances:

- The Lago EU Tax Management integration is activated;
- A customer profile is either created or updated. Changes in customer details could influence their applicable tax rates;
- Zipcodes are important to define tax exceptions. Make sure to define them for all your customers; and
- When a new tax rate is identified for a customer, Lago automatically updates the customer's profile by replacing the old tax rate with the new one.

## Logging VIES verifications
Lago ensures transparency and compliance by logging each VIES check. This occurs whenever you create or update a customer. 
For each check, Lago dispatches a webhook message. This allows you to record these validations for compliance purposes. 
You can access and review any of these automated checks as needed.
