## Create a webhook endpoint
<Tip>
    To complete this process, you will need:

    - Your Lago **organization ID**, available in the **"API keys & ID"** tab of the
    **"Developers"** section;
    - The **connection code** you created during the Moneyhash setup process.
</Tip>

If you want Lago to automatically retrieve the status of the payments processed
via Moneyhash, you must create a webhook endpoint in Moneyhash. To do so:

1. Log in to your Moneyhash account;
2. Add the following Webhook URL in the **Webhooks** section of the Moneyhash dashboard;
3. Enter the following URL: `https://api.getlago.com/webhooks/moneyhash/{{__YOUR_ORG_ID__}}?code={{__YOUR_CONNECTION_CODE}}` (you must replace `organization_id` with your Lago organization ID, and the `connection_code` by the targeted Lago connection); and
4. Save the creation of this webhook endpoint.

## Collect payments via Moneyhash

### Connect a Lago Customer to Moneyhash
To begin collecting payments for your Lago invoices via Moneyhash, you need to link a Lago customer to a Moneyhash connection. 
When creating or editing a customer in Lago, simply select the relevant Moneyhash connection under **external apps** to enable invoice payments.

### Generate a checkout link
Note that payments through Moneyhash does not automatically proceed when Lago generates an invoice. You need to programmatically generate a checkout link by calling the [following endpoint](/api-reference/invoices/payment-url):

```bash Request
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.getlago.com/api/v1/invoices/{lago_id}/payment_url \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

By generating this checkout link, you can forward it to your customer to complete payment using their preferred method from India. Once the payment is processed, Lago automatically retrieves the invoice status from Moneyhash.

```json Response
{
  "invoice_payment_details": {
    "lago_customer_id": "13b901a90-1a90-1a90-1a90-1a901a901a90",
    "lago_invoice_id": "1e501a90-938s-1a90-1a90-1a901a901a80",
    "external_customer_id": "53dj371e-4ea2-bcf9-57d3a41bc6ba",
    "payment_provider": "moneyhash",
    "payment_url": "https://moneyhash.payment_link"
  }
}
```

### Moneyhash payment errors
If an error occurs during the Moneyhash payment process for a Lago invoice, Lago sends a [`payment_request.payment_failure`](https://docs.getlago.com/api-reference/webhooks/messages#param-payment-request-payment-failure) webhook containing the error details.
