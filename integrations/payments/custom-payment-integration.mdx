  "This guide helps you integrate Lago with a custom payment provider. Build your own integration by following the steps below."
---

## Overview
This guide shows how to integrate a non-natively supported Payment Service Provider (PSP) into Lago.

It is modeled on the MoneyHash integration, and in most cases, you should duplicate and adapt the [MoneyHash](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/pulls?q=moneyhash) work from the following references:
- [MoneyHash Backend PRs](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/pull/3418)
- [MoneyHash Frontend PRs](https://github.com/getlago/lago-front/pulls?q=moneyhash)

<Info>
    Among all our native integrations, the Stripe one represents the gold standard and should always serve as the reference implementation.
</Info>

## Backend integration (API)

### API Version
If your PSP integration supports multiple versions, ensure you specify the version—for example, we are setting it for Stripe in this [Pull Request #3300](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/pull/3300).

### SDK
Don't hesitate to import any required gem if necessary.

### Services
Our codebase relies a lot on services. Some general rules:

- Extend `BaseService`
- Always return a result (never nil)
- A service should have one single method named `call`

Although the Stripe examples use services with multiple methods, we now recommend creating separate services each with a single call method; **if you prefer a single class with multiple public methods, you may ignore this guidance.**

```
Example:

# Instead of
PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeService#create
PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeService#update
PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeService#generate_checkout_url

# We recomend
PaymentProviderCustomers::Stripe::CreateService#call
PaymentProviderCustomers::Stripe::UpdateService#call
PaymentProviderCustomers::Stripe::GenerateCheckoutUrlService#call
```

### Payment Provider Class
All payment provider subscriptions inherit from the PaymentProviderSubscription class via STI. For instance, to support Checkout.com, register a new `CheckoutComSubscription` in `app/models/payment_provider_subscriptions/checkout_com_subscription.rb`.

A few notes about providers:
- Store custom provider details with `settings_accessors` instead of adding database columns;
- Use `secret_accessors` to securely store sensitive data (e.g., API keys); and
- Map the new PSP's payment status values to Lago's three statuses: processing, success, and failed.

```ruby
module PaymentProviders
	class CheckoutComProvider < BaseProvider
    # Lago payment_status -> Checkout.com statuses mapping
    PROCESSING_STATUSES = %w[].freeze
    SUCCESS_STATUSES = %w[].freeze
    FAILED_STATUSES = %w[].freeze
	
	  secrets_accessors :api_key
	
		validates :api_key, presence: true
	
    def payment_type
      "checkout_com"
    end
  end
end
```

Ensure the new Payment Provider is included in every provider switch/case statement:
```ruby
case type
    when 'moneyhash'
        PaymentProviders::MoneyHashProvider.new(provider_instance)
    when 'checkout_com'
        PaymentProviders::CheckoutComProvider.new(provider_instance)
    ...
end
```

### Webhooks
Ideally, configure the new Payment Provider to send webhooks any time a payment or customer is updated. The Stripe integration is the most mature and should serve as the reference implementation. The callback URL must include both the `organization_id` and the provider `code`:
```ruby
URI.join(
  ENV["LAGO_API_URL"],
  "webhooks/checkoutcom/#{organization_id}?code=#{URI.encode_www_form_component(payment_provider.code)}"
)
```

See `PaymentProviders::Stripe::RegisterWebhookService` for more details.

To process webhook messages:

- Register route;
- Add method to `app/controllers/webhooks_controller.rb`;
- Save the webhook in `IncomingWebhook` and dispatch a job to process it; and
- Ideally, one service maps to one webhook type.

The Stripe integration has been partially refactored but still preserves backward compatibility with `HandleEvent` job arguments, so your services can be simpler.

### Backend integration checklist

Here is a list of files and classes you may need to create or update, each accompanied by a brief description. In our case, we take the example of a new integration with Checkout.com, but you can adapt the following list to your PSP.

#### 10. Specs

## Frontend integration (UI)
All frontend actions are located in the [lago-front](https://github.com/getlago/lago-front) repository.

Please refer to an existing PSP implementation to make sure you use the latest code guidelines and structure, as code might evolve in the future.

To ease the work on the Frontend side, make sure all type and enums are updated on the Backend first and run the `codegen` script to get the new graph.

### New integration CRUD
Any new integration needs to be listed on the page `src/pages/settings/Integrations.tsx`

Then, new routes and components need to be created for the PSP connection lists, details, edition and deletion.

To start, have a look at these files in the app:
```plaintext
src/
├── pages/
│   └── settings/
│       ├── Integrations.tsx
│       ├── [PSPName]IntegrationDetails.tsx
│       └── [PSPName]Integrations.tsx
├── components/
│   └── settings/
│       ├── Add[PSPName]Dialog.tsx
│       └── Delete[PSPName]Dialog.tsx
└── public/
    └── images/
        └── [PSPName].svg
```

Please make sure the SVG is as clean as possible and uses viewbox rather than width and height (viewBox="0 0 40 40”, refer to other images). You can use https://svgomg.net/ to help.

### Customer link
You also need to update the customer flow to allow connection to your new PSP.

This happens primarily in the `PaymentProvidersAccordion` component. It needs to be updated to handle the selection of this new PSP option.

### Global UI updates
Update the following places responsible for displaying PSP information:
- `src/components/PaymentProviderChip.tsx` (displays the PSP chip in multiple places)
- `src/pages/PaymentDetails.tsx` (if you wish to have clickable payment url links)
