**PREMIUM ADD-ON** ✨

This integration is available upon request only. Please **[contact us](mailto:hello@getlago.com)** to get access to this premium integration.
</Info>

## RESTlet script configuration
Lago's native integration with NetSuite utilizes a [custom RESTlet script](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_4618456517.html) to provide maximum flexibility in fetching or pushing billing data. To set up the Lago RESTlet script in your NetSuite instance, follow these steps:

### Upload Lago Scripts
1. In NetSuite, go to **Documents > Files > File Cabinet**;
2. Under `SuiteScripts`, create a new folder named `Lago`;
3. **Upload `ramda.min.js`**: This library is essential for using Lago and can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/blob/master/dist/ramda.min.js); and
4. Upload another file into the `Lago` folder and **paste the script provided by your Lago Account Manager**.

</Frame>

### Deploy Lago Scripts

1. Navigate to **Customization > Scripting > Scripts > Create a New Script**;
2. Deploy the Lago script for **All roles** and **All employees** (you can create custom roles if needed); and
3. Make sure to change the script status to `released`.


By deploying this script, you'll generate a **custom endpoint url** that is crucial for the authentication process and enables seamless data synchronization between Lago and NetSuite.

## Mandatory NetSuite settings
To ensure the sync doesn't fail, verify that the following settings are correctly configured. This will enable Lago to sync data to NetSuite properly.

### Remove Locations on invoices and credit memos
Lago doesn't recognize the location field on invoices, which is mandatory by default. To resolve this, remove the location requirement from your invoice form:
1. Navigate to **Customization > Forms > Transaction Forms**;
2. Locate the form related to your invoices;
3. Go to the **Screen Fields** tab; and
4. Find the Location field and **uncheck both the Show and Mandatory checkboxes**.

</Frame>

<Info>
  You can repeat the same operation for Credit Memos
</Info>

### Create Lago Tax Nexus, Type and Code
To have Lago override the tax details for your invoice line items, follow these steps. If not, Lago will send the amount excluding taxes to NetSuite.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Create a Lago Tax Nexus">
    1. Go to **Setup** > **Tax** > **Nexuses** > **New**;
    2. Choose a brand new **Nexus** (⚠️ ensure it's unused by other existing tax nexuses. It can be a new state for an existing country, or a new country.);
    3. Enter `Lago Tax Nexus` in the **Description** field;
    4. Create a new **Tax Agency** by clicking the **+** button. Name it `Lago Tax Agency` and assign it to the relevant parent subsidiary;
    5. Save your new Nexus;
    6. Add this newly created Nexus to the targeted NetSuite Subsidiaries by navigating to **Setup > Company > Subsidiaries**. Select the parent subsidiary, and add this new nexus in the **Tax Registrations** tab; and
    7. Ensure that the tax engine for this registration is set to `SuiteTax Engine`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Create a Lago Tax Type">
    1. Navigate to **Setup** > **Tax** > **Tax Types** > **New**;
    2. Select the same **Country** as the one used in the Lago Tax Nexus;
    3. Name it `Lago Tax Type`;
    4. **Link the Lago Tax Nexus** in the Nexus section;
    5. Add a **Payables Account** and a **Receivables Account** to this new Tax Type; and
    6. Save it.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Create a Lago Tax Code">
    1. Go to **Setup** > **Tax** > **Tax Code** > **New**;
    2. Enter a **Name**, like `Lago Tax`;
    3. Select and tie the previously created Lago Tax Type; and
    4. Save your settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>



### Define Taxable items
To enable tax amount overrides for your Lago invoices synced to NetSuite, ensure all items are marked as taxable. If any item is non-taxable, the invoice sync will fail. To update an item:

1. Go to **Lists > Accounting > Items**;
2. Edit the item associated with a Lago object;
3. Navigate to the **Accounting** tab;
4. Locate the **Tax / Tariff** section; and
5. Set the item to **Taxable**.

<Frame caption="Define Taxable items">

</Frame>

## Connecting Lago to NetSuite
To fully integrate Lago with NetSuite, start by connecting your Lago instance to a new NetSuite connection. 
You can have an unlimited number of NetSuite connections. First, link your NetSuite account to Lago. 
Once connected, activate the specific syncs and actions required for your use case. 
This ensures that your Lago instance is properly configured to communicate with NetSuite, enabling seamless data synchronization and management.

## Mapping items between Lago and NetSuite
**Mapping between Lago and NetSuite is done by Lago Entity → NetSuite Subsidiary**. You can define a
default mapping that applies across all subsidiaries, but a single item (including tax items)
can be mapped differently for each subsidiary. When a mapping is defined for a specific Lago
entity, that entity-specific mapping overrides the default mapping for the corresponding
NetSuite subsidiary. If all your entities share the same mapping, you only need to configure
the default mapping.

Follow these steps to map items or tax items between Lago and NetSuite:
1. Navigate to the **NetSuite Integration** page in Lago;
2. Select the **Item Mapping** tab;
3. Click on the item you want to map;
4. Fill all the required fields; and
5. Save your mapping.

<Frame caption="Map items per entity and subsidiary between Lago and NetSuite">
  <img src="/integrations/images/netsuite-entity-mapping.png" />
</Frame>

<Info>
  The item mapping must be completed before syncing invoices, credit notes, or payments to NetSuite. Anytime a new item is created in Lago, it must be mapped to a NetSuite item to ensure successful synchronization.
</Info>

### Mapping a fallback item
The fallback item is a dummy item used as a backup in case the mapping of other objects fails. 
To ensure continuous data synchronization between Lago and NetSuite, this fallback item will be used whenever there is a mapping issue.

<Info>
This mapping follows a one-to-many structure, meaning that a single fallback item can be used to handle multiple mapping issues.
</Info>

<Frame caption="Map a fallback item between Lago and NetSuite">
  <img src="/integrations/images/netsuite-fallback-item.png" />
</Frame>

### Mapping a tax item
To override the tax amount for an invoice, sales order, or credit note, you need to map a single tax item from NetSuite. 
This mapped item will be used to assign the correct tax amount.

**To ensure taxes are sent from Lago to NetSuite, complete the tax mapping** for the following [tax fields you created here](#create-lago-tax-nexus-type-and-code):
1. Tax Nexus;
2. Tax Type; and
3. Tax Code.

Use the `id` for each item, found either in the UI or in the URL of the specific item. You can define a specific tax mapping for each Lago entity or NetSuite Subsidiary.

<Info>
This mapping follows a one-to-many structure, meaning that a single tax item can be mapped to override all tax amounts issued by Lago.
</Info>

<Frame caption="Map a tax item between Lago and NetSuite">
  <img src="/integrations/images/mapping-tax-item-netsuite.png" />
</Frame>

### Mapping default objects
Coupons, credit notes, subscription fees, minimum commitments, and prepaid credits require a one-to-many mapping. 
Each of these objects must be mapped to a single default item from your NetSuite instance. Lago will use this mapped item 
whenever any of these objects appear on the final invoice sent to NetSuite. You can override the default mapping for each Lago entity or NetSuite Subsidiary if needed.

<Info>
This mapping follows a one-to-many structure, meaning a single item can handle multiple mappings for coupons, credit notes, subscription fees, minimum commitments, and prepaid credits.
</Info>

<Frame caption="Map default items between Lago and NetSuite">
  <img src="/integrations/images/mapping-default-items-netsuite.png" />
</Frame>


### Mapping custom objects
Billable metrics and add-ons require a one-to-one mapping. Each billable metric, used for usage-based billing, must represent a specific SKU in your NetSuite instance. 
You need to map each of these individually. Lago will use the mapped items whenever any of these metrics or add-ons appear on the final invoice sent to NetSuite.
You can override the default mapping for each Lago entity or NetSuite Subsidiary if needed.

<Info>
This mapping follows a one-to-one structure, meaning each billable metric or add-on must be mapped to a specific NetSuite item.
</Info>

## Mapping currencies between Lago and NetSuite
As NetSuite supports multiple currencies for a single customer, it's essential to map the currencies used in Lago to those in NetSuite. 
This ensures that all financial data is accurately represented and synchronized between the two systems. To map currencies, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the **NetSuite Integration** page in Lago;
2. Select the **Currency Mapping** tab;
3. Click the **Add Currency mapping** button; and
4. Map the Lago currency code with the currency ID used in NetSuite.

## Customers synchronization
When creating or updating a Lago customer, you can choose to link it to a NetSuite customer.

The first option is to **automatically create a new customer from Lago to NetSuite**. Follow these steps:
1. Create or update a new Lago customer;
2. Select the targeted NetSuite connection;
3. Check the box labeled 'Create this customer automatically in NetSuite';
4. Choose a NetSuite subsidiary from the list (Lago will fetch the list of subsidiaries from your NetSuite instance); and
5. Save and create this new customer.

If the customer is successfully created in NetSuite, a new field will be displayed in the Lago customer view, providing a direct link to the corresponding NetSuite customer.

<Info>
Customer creation from Lago to NetSuite happens in real-time with only a few seconds of delay.
</Info>


<Frame caption="Lago customer integrated with NetSuite">
  <img src="/integrations/images/sync-customers-netsuite.png" />
</Frame>

The second option is to **import an existing NetSuite customer to a Lago customer**. Follow these steps:
1. Create or update a Lago customer;
2. Select the targeted NetSuite connection;
3. Ensure the box labeled 'Create this customer automatically in NetSuite' is unchecked;
4. Paste the NetSuite customer ID in the appropriate field; and
5. Save and create this new customer.

## Invoices synchronization
If a Lago customer is linked to a NetSuite customer, Lago syncs invoices to NetSuite Invoices in real-time.

It's important to note the following:
- Each fee issued by Lago is synced as a line item on a NetSuite invoice;
- The Lago fee `units` are synced to NetSuite as `quantity`;
- The Lago fee `precise_unit_amount` is synced to NetSuite as `rate`;
- Lago overrides the total tax amount of a NetSuite invoice using the tax item, as NetSuite does not support tax details at the line item level; and
- Any discounts on an invoice (coupon, credit note, or prepaid credits) are synced as negative line items on the NetSuite invoice.

If the invoice is successfully created in NetSuite, a new field will be displayed in the Lago invoice view, providing a direct link to the corresponding NetSuite invoice.

<Info>
Invoice creation from Lago to NetSuite happens in real-time with only a few seconds of delay.
</Info>

</Frame>

## Credit Notes synchronization
If a Lago customer is linked to a NetSuite customer, Lago syncs credit notes to NetSuite Credit Memos in real-time.

It's important to note the following:
- Each fee refunded by Lago is synced as a line item on a NetSuite Credit Memo;
- Lago overrides the total tax amount of a NetSuite credit memo using the tax item, as NetSuite does not support tax details at the line item level; and
- Any discounts on an credit note (like coupon, for instance) are synced as line items on the NetSuite Credit Memo.

If the credit note is successfully created in NetSuite, a new field will be displayed in the Lago credit note view, providing a direct link to the corresponding NetSuite Credit Memo.

<Info>
Credit note creation from Lago to NetSuite happens in real-time with only a few seconds of delay.
</Info>

## Payments synchronization
If a Lago invoice is tied to a NetSuite invoice, Lago automatically syncs payments occurring in Lago to NetSuite, updating in-real time the payment status of the invoice in NetSuite.
You can also retrieve payments for invoices paid directly in NetSuite.

## Integration logs
Whenever an issue occurs in NetSuite, Lago will notify you through a [webhook message](/api-reference/webhooks/messages#accounting-provider-error) called `customer.accounting_provider_error`.
You can also **view integration logs inside NetSuite** for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.
