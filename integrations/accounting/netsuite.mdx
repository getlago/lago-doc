**PREMIUM ADD-ON** ✨

This integration is available upon request only. Please **[contact us](mailto:hello@getlago.com)** to get access to this premium integration.
</Info>

## RESTlet script configuration
Lago's native integration with NetSuite utilizes a [custom RESTlet script](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_4618456517.html) to provide maximum flexibility in fetching or pushing billing data. To set up the Lago RESTlet script in your NetSuite instance, follow these steps:

### Upload Lago Scripts
1. In NetSuite, go to **Documents > Files > File Cabinet**;
2. Under `SuiteScripts`, create a new folder named `Lago`;
3. **Upload `ramda.min.js`**: This library is essential for using Lago and can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/blob/master/dist/ramda.min.js); and
4. Upload another file into the `Lago` folder and **paste the script provided by your Lago Account Manager**.

</Frame>

### Deploy Lago Scripts

1. Navigate to **Customization > Scripting > Scripts > Create a New Script**;
2. Deploy the Lago script for **All roles** and **All employees** (you can create custom roles if needed); and
3. Make sure to change the script status to `released`.


By deploying this script, you'll generate a **custom endpoint url** that is crucial for the authentication process and enables seamless data synchronization between Lago and NetSuite.

## Mandatory NetSuite settings
To ensure the sync doesn't fail, verify that the following settings are correctly configured. This will enable Lago to sync data to NetSuite properly.

### Remove Locations on invoices and credit memos
Lago doesn't recognize the location field on invoices, which is mandatory by default. To resolve this, remove the location requirement from your invoice form:
1. Navigate to **Customization > Forms > Transaction Forms**;
2. Locate the form related to your invoices;
3. Go to the **Screen Fields** tab; and
4. Find the Location field and **uncheck both the Show and Mandatory checkboxes**.

<Info>
  You can repeat the same operation for Credit Memos

### Create Lago Tax Nexus, Type and Code
To have Lago override the tax details for your invoice line items, follow these steps. If not, Lago will send the amount excluding taxes to NetSuite.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Create a Lago Tax Nexus">
    1. Go to **Setup** > **Tax** > **Nexuses** > **New**;
    2. Choose a brand new **Nexus** (⚠️ ensure it's unused by other existing tax nexuses. It can be a new state for an existing country, or a new country.);
    3. Enter `Lago Tax Nexus` in the **Description** field;
    4. Create a new **Tax Agency** by clicking the **+** button. Name it `Lago Tax Agency` and assign it to the relevant parent subsidiary;
    5. Save your changes;
    6. Add this newly created Nexus to the targeted NetSuite Subsidiaries by navigating to **Setup > Company > Tax Registrations**; and
    7. Ensure that the tax engine for this registration is set to `SuiteTax Engine`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Create a Lago Tax Type">
    1. Navigate to **Setup** > **Tax** > **Tax Types** > **New**;
    2. Select the same **Country** as the one used in the Lago Tax Nexus;
    3. Name it `Lago Tax Type`;
    4. **Link the Lago Tax Nexus** in the Nexus section; and
    5. Save it.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Create a Lago Tax Code">
    1. Go to **Setup** > **Tax** > **Tax Code** > **New**;
    2. Enter a **Name**, like `Lago Tax`;
    3. Select and tie the previously created Lago Tax Type; and
    4. Save your settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>



### Define Taxable items
To enable tax amount overrides for your Lago invoices synced to NetSuite, ensure all items are marked as taxable. If any item is non-taxable, the invoice sync will fail. To update an item:

1. Go to **Lists > Accounting > Items**;
2. Edit the item associated with a Lago object;
3. Navigate to the **Accounting** tab;
4. Locate the **Tax / Tariff** section; and
5. Set the item to **Taxable**.

<Frame caption="Define Taxable items">
  <img src="/integrations/images/netsuite-taxable-items.png" />
</Frame>

## Connecting Lago to NetSuite
To fully integrate Lago with NetSuite, start by connecting your Lago instance to a new NetSuite connection. 
You can have an unlimited number of NetSuite connections. First, link your NetSuite account to Lago. 
Once connected, activate the specific syncs and actions required for your use case. 
This ensures that your Lago instance is properly configured to communicate with NetSuite, enabling seamless data synchronization and management.

## Mapping items between Lago and NetSuite
To sync invoices, credit notes, sales orders, and payments to NetSuite, Lago establishes a one-to-one relationship between Lago objects and NetSuite objects. 
Follow these steps to map an item:
- **Access a NetSuite Connection in Lago:** navigate to your connected NetSuite integration within the Lago platform;
- **Select the Item to map:** click on the specific item in Lago that you wish to map to a corresponding NetSuite item;
- **Fetch Items from NetSuite:** Lago will automatically retrieve the relevant items from your NetSuite instance;
- **Map the Item:** choose the appropriate NetSuite item from the list provided by Lago; and
- **Click 'Save'** to finalize the mapping.

### Mapping a fallback item (mandatory)
The fallback item is a dummy item used as a backup in case the mapping of other objects fails. 
To ensure continuous data synchronization between Lago and NetSuite, this fallback item will be used whenever there is a mapping issue.

<Info>
This mapping follows a one-to-many structure, meaning that a single fallback item can be used to handle multiple mapping issues.
</Info>

<Frame caption="Map a fallback item between Lago and NetSuite">
  <img src="/integrations/images/netsuite-fallback-item.png" />
</Frame>

### Mapping a tax item
To override the tax amount for an invoice, sales order, or credit note, you need to map a single tax item from NetSuite. 
This mapped item will be used to assign the correct tax amount.

**To ensure taxes are sent from Lago to NetSuite, complete the tax mapping** for the following [tax fields you created here](#create-lago-tax-nexus-type-and-code):
1. Tax Nexus;
2. Tax Type; and
3. Tax Code.

Use the `id` for each item, found either in the UI or in the URL of the specific item.

<Info>
This mapping follows a one-to-many structure, meaning that a single tax item can be mapped to override all tax amounts issued by Lago.
</Info>

<Frame caption="Map a tax item between Lago and NetSuite">
  <img src="/integrations/images/mapping-tax-item-netsuite.png" />
</Frame>

### Mapping default objects
Coupons, credit notes, subscription fees, minimum commitments, and prepaid credits require a one-to-many mapping. 
Each of these objects must be mapped to a single default item from your NetSuite instance. Lago will use this mapped item 
whenever any of these objects appear on the final invoice sent to NetSuite.

<Info>
This mapping follows a one-to-many structure, meaning a single item can handle multiple mappings for coupons, credit notes, subscription fees, minimum commitments, and prepaid credits.
</Info>

<Frame caption="Map default items between Lago and NetSuite">
  <img src="/integrations/images/mapping-default-items-netsuite.png" />
</Frame>


### Mapping custom objects
Billable metrics and add-ons require a one-to-one mapping. Each billable metric, used for usage-based billing, must represent a specific SKU in your NetSuite instance. 
You need to map each of these individually. Lago will use the mapped items whenever any of these metrics or add-ons appear on the final invoice sent to NetSuite.

<Info>
This mapping follows a one-to-one structure, meaning each billable metric or add-on must be mapped to a specific NetSuite item.
</Info>

## Customers synchronization
When creating or updating a Lago customer, you can choose to link it to a NetSuite customer.

The first option is to **automatically create a new customer from Lago to NetSuite**. Follow these steps:
1. Create or update a new Lago customer;
2. Select the targeted NetSuite connection;
3. Check the box labeled 'Create this customer automatically in NetSuite';
4. Choose a NetSuite subsidiary from the list (Lago will fetch the list of subsidiaries from your NetSuite instance); and
5. Save and create this new customer.

If the customer is successfully created in NetSuite, a new field will be displayed in the Lago customer view, providing a direct link to the corresponding NetSuite customer.

<Info>
Customer creation from Lago to NetSuite happens in real-time with only a few seconds of delay.
</Info>


<Frame caption="Lago customer integrated with NetSuite">
  <img src="/integrations/images/sync-customers-netsuite.png" />
</Frame>

The second option is to **import an existing NetSuite customer to a Lago customer**. Follow these steps:
1. Create or update a Lago customer;
2. Select the targeted NetSuite connection;
3. Ensure the box labeled 'Create this customer automatically in NetSuite' is unchecked;
4. Paste the NetSuite customer ID in the appropriate field; and
5. Save and create this new customer.

**Here is the list of fields that is currently synced to NetSuite:**
| Lago | NetSuite |
| --- | --- |
| customer | type |
| customer.name | companyname |
| customer.netsuite_subsidiary | subsidiary |
| customer.id | custbody_lago_id |
| customer.email | email |
| customer.phone | phone |
| customer.external_salesforce_id | custentity_lago_sf_id |


## Invoices synchronization
If a Lago customer is linked to a NetSuite customer, Lago syncs invoices to NetSuite Invoices in real-time.

It's important to note the following:
- Each fee issued by Lago is synced as a line item on a NetSuite invoice;
- The Lago fee `units` are synced to NetSuite as `quantity`;
- The Lago fee `precise_unit_amount` is synced to NetSuite as `rate`;
- Lago overrides the total tax amount of a NetSuite invoice using the tax item, as NetSuite does not support tax details at the line item level; and
- Any discounts on an invoice (coupon, credit note, or prepaid credits) are synced as negative line items on the NetSuite invoice.

If the invoice is successfully created in NetSuite, a new field will be displayed in the Lago invoice view, providing a direct link to the corresponding NetSuite invoice.

| invoice.fee.precise_unit_amount | lineItems.rate |

## Credit Notes synchronization
If a Lago customer is linked to a NetSuite customer, Lago syncs credit notes to NetSuite Credit Memos in real-time.

It's important to note the following:
- Each fee refunded by Lago is synced as a line item on a NetSuite Credit Memo;
- Lago overrides the total tax amount of a NetSuite credit memo using the tax item, as NetSuite does not support tax details at the line item level; and
- Any discounts on an credit note (like coupon, for instance) are synced as line items on the NetSuite Credit Memo.

If the credit note is successfully created in NetSuite, a new field will be displayed in the Lago credit note view, providing a direct link to the corresponding NetSuite Credit Memo.

<Info>

## Payments synchronization
If a Lago invoice is tied to a NetSuite invoice, Lago automatically syncs payments occurring in Lago to NetSuite, updating in-real time the payment status of the invoice in NetSuite.

| Lago | NetSuite |
| --- | --- |
| customerpayment | type |
| customer.netsuite_internal_id | customer |
| invoice.netsuite_internal_id | lineItems.doc |
| true | lineItems.apply |
