## Create a one-off invoice
To create a one-off invoice for a specific customer:

1. Select the customer from the list of customers; and
2. Click the **"Actions"** button located in the upper-right corner and select **"Create one-off invoice"**.

## Adding add-ons to one-off invoices
Now that you have started the flow to create a one-off invoice, it's time to add one or several add-ons to it:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    1. Click **"Add an add-on"** to add a new add-on to the invoice;
    2. Edit the number of units applied for a specific add-on;
    3. Edit the unit price of a specific add-on (you can define it as 0 if needed);
    4. Edit the description of the add-on displayed on the invoice; and
    5. Click **"Create"** to issue your one-off invoice.

            "description": "Implementation fee with a solution engineer"
          },
          {
            "add_on_code": "customer_success",
            "units": 2,
            "unit_amount_cents": 100000,
            "description": "One off customer success fee"
          }
        ]
      }
    }'
  ```
  </Tab>

## Application scope of one-off invoices
Here are a few things to keep in mind about one-off invoices:

- One-off invoices are issued immediately and can include the same add-on multiple times.
- If the currency of the customer is already defined, the currency of the one-off invoice must be the same.
- You can use the same add-on to create one-off invoices for multiple customers whose subscriptions don't have the same currency or to apply a different amount for one of these customers.
- Coupons or prepaid credits (discounts) **do not apply** to one-off invoices.
- One-off invoices are subject to taxes, as defined in the customer view.

<Tip>

Note that when using the API endpoint, if the amount and currency are null, Lago will apply the default amount and currency defined in the UI.

</Tip>

## Invoicing

As mentioned previously, a **one-off invoice is invoiced straight away**. You are able to find one-off invoices through webhook with webhook message called `invoice.one_off_created`.
