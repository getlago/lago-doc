Add-ons represent non-recurring fixed charges. Once created, they can be:
- Added to a plan as a [fixed charge](/guide/plans/charges/fixed-charges), or
- Applied directly to a customer through a [one-off invoice](/guide/one-off-invoices/create-one-off-invoices)

## Use an add-on
Once created, an add-on can be:
- Added to a **plan** as a fixed charge, or
- Applied to a **specific customer** through a one-off invoice

## Manage add-ons
From the **Add-ons** section, you can edit or delete existing add-ons using the ellipsis menu.
- **Editing** lets you update the name, code, description, and default values  
- **Deleting** permanently removes the add-on from all plans and subscriptions where it is used *(this action cannot be undone)*
