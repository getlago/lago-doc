title: "Net payment term"
---

A net payment term refers to the specified number of days within which the end customer is required to settle the invoice after its finalization. 
This term not only affects the `payment_due_date` within the invoice payload but also influences the due date mentioned in the downloadable PDF version of the invoice.

To illustrate, consider the following scenario: 
a billing cycle spanning one month, accompanied by a net payment term of 15 days.

## Application scope[](#application-scope "Direct link to heading")

The net payment term period applies to all types of invoices, and is used to compute the payment due date.

When the `payment_due_date` has passed, the invoice is flagged as overdue (`payment_overdue` = `true`), and Lago emits an `invoice.payment_overdue`
[webhook message](/api-reference/webhooks/messages).

The invoice stays flagged as overdue until the payment is `succeeded`, or `payment_dispute_lost_at` is applied, or the invoice is voided.

## Define a net payment term at organization level[](#define-a-net-payment-term-at-organization-level "Direct link to heading")

The customer's net payment term supersedes the one defined at the organization level. 
It exclusively applies to the associated customer.
