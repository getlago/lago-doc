## Editing and deleting taxes[](#edit-delete-taxes "Direct link to heading")

A tax can be deleted or edited even if it is linked to an organization or a customer. 
However, it's important to note that any change made to a tax object, including its removal, has an impact on all existing draft invoices or upcoming invoices associated with this tax.

Available actions include:
- **Edit**: allows you to modify the name, code and rate of the tax object; and
- **Delete**: allows you to delete the tax object and remove it from the list (this action cannot be undone).

## Apply taxes to objects
When generating invoices, you may need to apply taxes. 
The tax rate applies to all fees (i.e. subscription fees and charges) and appears on the invoices.

## Tax hierarchy

### Invoice linked to a subscription
When an invoice linked to a subscription is generated, 
the taxation process follows a hierarchy that determines how taxes are applied to different fees:

1. Taxes defined at the **organization** level will impact all invoice fees (subscription & charges).
2. Taxes defined at the **customer** level will override the organization-level taxes and impact all invoice fees (subscription & charges).
3. Taxes defined at the **plan** level will override the customer-level taxes and impact all invoice fees (subscription & charges).
4. Taxes defined at the **charge** level will override the plan-level taxes but will impact only the fee associated with that particular charge.


### Invoice linked to a one-off-invoice
When an invoice linked to a one-off is generated, the taxation process follows a hierarchy that determines how taxes are applied to different fees:

1. Taxes defined at the **organization** level will impact all invoice fees
2. Taxes defined at the **customer** level will override the organization-level taxes and impact all invoice fees
3. Taxes defined at the **add-on** level will override the customer-level taxes and impact only the fee associated with that particular add-on
4. While creating a one-off invoice, taxes defined at the **fees** level will override add-on-level taxes but will solely impact the fee associated with that particular add-on.

### Invoice linked to prepaid credit

Since we treat the purchase of credits as an upfront payment before usage, invoices generated for prepaid credit purchases will not include any taxes.
