## Overview
**By default, Lago dates invoices on the first day of the new billing period** (e.g., November 1st for an October usage and subscription). 
Some businesses need invoices dated on the last day of the billing period instead (e.g., October 31st) for accounting or compliance reasons.
This feature gives you control over the issuing date displayed on your invoices.

Note that this is configured at the **Billing Entity level** and applies to all customers under that entity. However, you can override it for specific customers when needed.

## Invoice settings

### Issuing date anchor
This setting determines which **issuing date** appears on your invoice.

| Option | Description | For Oct. billing period |
|--------|-------------|----------------------------|
| `next_period_start` (default value) | Invoice dated on first day of next billing period | Issuing Date: **November 1** |
| `current_period_end` | Invoice dated on last day of the current billing period | Issuing Date: **October 31** |

### Issuing date adjustment
This setting controls what happens when an invoice is finalized **after** the anchor date, especially when a grace period greater than 0 is configured.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `align_with_finalization_date` (default) | Invoice date updates to actual finalization date |
| `keep_anchor` | Invoice keeps the anchor date regardless of when finalized |

## Examples
The following examples show how different combinations of settings affect the invoice issuing date for a subscription with a billing period from **October 1st to October 31st**. 
The grace period determines when the invoice is finalized after the billing period ends.

| Anchor | Adjustment | Grace Period | Invoice Issuing Date |
|--------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| `next_period_start` | `align_with_finalization_date` | 0 days | **November 1** |
| `next_period_start` | `align_with_finalization_date` | 2 days | **November 3** |
| `next_period_start` | `keep_anchor` | 2 days | **November 1** |
| `current_period_end` | `align_with_finalization_date` | 2 days | **November 3** |
| `current_period_end` | `keep_anchor` | 2 days | **October 31** |

## Common use cases

### Standard billing (default)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `subscription_invoice_issuing_date_anchor` | `next_period_start` |
| `subscription_invoice_issuing_date_adjustment` | `align_with_finalization_date` |

Best for most businesses. Invoice dates reflect when invoices are actually issued, which simplifies payment tracking and customer communication.

### Period-end accounting
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `subscription_invoice_issuing_date_anchor` | `current_period_end` |
| `subscription_invoice_issuing_date_adjustment` | `keep_anchor` |

Ideal for businesses that need invoices dated within the same month as the service period for revenue recognition or accounting compliance. Example: An October subscription invoice will always show October 31, even if generated in November.

### Fixed period start dates
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `subscription_invoice_issuing_date_anchor` | `next_period_start` |
| `subscription_invoice_issuing_date_adjustment` | `keep_anchor` |

Useful when you want consistent invoice dates aligned to billing cycle starts, regardless of processing delays. Example: Monthly invoices always dated on the 1st of each month.
