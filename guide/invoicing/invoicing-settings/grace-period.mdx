A grace period is the number of days during which invoices remain in `draft` status, allowing you to review and modify them before they are finalized and sent for payment collection.

In the illustration below, the billing period spans one month, followed by a three-day grace period.

## Define a grace period at billing entity level[](#define-a-grace-period-at-organization-level "Direct link to heading")

The grace period set at the billing entity level applies to all customers linked to this entity by default.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
      To set a grace period from the Lago Dashboard:

      1. Access the **"Settings"** section via the side menu;
      2. Open the **Billing entity** > **"Invoicing settings"** section;
      3. Click **"Edit"** in the **"Grace period"** section;
      4. Enter the number of days associated with the grace period; and
      5. Click **"Edit grace period"** to confirm.

      <Warning>
        If you shorten the organization's grace period, some invoices in `draft`
        status may be automatically `finalized`. For instance, if the initial grace
        period was five days, but then three days into the grace period you decide to
        reduce it to two days, then all `draft` invoices will automatically switch to
        `finalized`.
      </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">
    You can also modify the entity's grace period at any time through [the API](/api-reference/billing-entities/update).
      <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Add a grace period on the organization {28}
      LAGO_URL="https://api.getlago.com"
      API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"

      curl --location --request PUT "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/billing_entities/{code}" \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-raw '{
          "organization": {
              "invoice_grace_period": 3
          }
        }'

## Define a grace period at customer level[](#define-a-grace-period-at-customer-level "Direct link to heading")

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
      To define a grace period at customer level through the user interface:
			
			1. Go to the **Customers** section in the side menu;  
			2. Select a customer;  
			3. Open the **Settings** tab in the customer view;

      <Warning>
        If you shorten the customer's grace period, some invoices in `draft` status
        may be automatically `finalized`. For instance, if the initial grace period
        was five days, but then three days into the grace period you decide to reduce
        it to two days, then all `draft` invoices will automatically switch to
        `finalized`.

The customer-specific grace period overrides the billing entity’s default grace period. It only applies to the customer it is configured for.


## Application scope and possible actions[](#application-scope-and-possible-actions "Direct link to heading")

The grace period applies exclusively to **subscription** invoices. It does not apply to invoices related to add-ons or credit purchases.

The creation of a `draft` invoice triggers the `invoice.drafted`
[webhook](/api-reference/webhooks/messages).

While an invoice is in draft status, you can:
- **Add usage records** by sending event with a valid timestamp within the billing period
- **Edit specific fees** (adjusting total amount or unit count)
- **Apply coupons** to the customer’s account
- **Add credits** to the customer’s wallet or credit note wallet

Please follow this page to know more about these actions.
