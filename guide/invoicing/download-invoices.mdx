### Add an invoice custom section
A custom invoice section is an additional section displayed above the custom footer on an invoice. 
It allows you to set a title and include specific details (e.g. bank details). 
Custom invoice sections can be applied at the organization level, impacting all customer invoices, or set per customer for greater granularity.

To create an invoice custom section:
1. Click **"Settings"** in the side menu;
2. Open the **"Invoice"** tab;
3. Click on **"Add"** in the **"Invoice custom section** block;
4. Provide the necessary details, including the title and content.
5. Click **Preview** to see how the section will appear on an invoice.
6. Toggle the switch to apply the custom section to all customer invoices within the organization.

<Info>
You can display multiple custom invoice sections on invoices. Note that they will be sorted alphabetically by the custom section name.
</Info>

You can override the organization-level setting for specific customers by either assigning a different invoice custom section or deactivating the option for that customer. To do so:
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    1. Click on a specific customer;
    2. Navigate to the **Settings** tab;
    3. Click on **Edit** in the Invoice custom section;
    4. Add a specific custom invoice section for the customer; or
    5. Choose to deactivate the invoice custom section for this customer.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">
      <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Update the customer invoice custom section
      LAGO_URL="https://api.getlago.com"
      API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"

      curl --location --request POST "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/customers" \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-raw '{
          "customer": {
		        …
            "skip_invoice_custom_sections": false, // If true, no invoice custom sections will be applied to the customer
            "invoice_custom_section_codes": ["eu_bank_details"] // Leave empty to use the organization-level settings
            …
          }
        }'
      ```
      </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Once the settings are updated, all newly finalized invoices for the organization or specific customer will reflect the changes.
