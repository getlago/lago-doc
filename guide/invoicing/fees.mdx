description: "A fee is a line item in an invoice."

There are few types of fees:

- **Subscription fees** which correspond to the plan’s base amount;
- **Fixed charge fees** which apply fixed recurring amounts defined by add-ons in plans;
- **Charge fees** which represent usage-based costs tied to billable metrics in plans and can be linked to a true-up fee;
- **Add-on fees** which appear as line items on one-off invoices;
- **Credits** which reflect the purchase of prepaid credits.

Information about fees includes (but is not limited to):

- Type;
- Amount;
- Currency; and
- Taxes.

The fee object is embedded within an invoice or credit note object, making it retrievable on its own.
This is illustrated below.:

## Update fee payment status

<Info>
  The `payment_status` of a fee can only be configured if `lago_invoice_id` is
  `null`.
</Info>

This option allows you to define the payment status of a fee yourself. The available options are: `pending`, `succeeded`, `failed`, and `refunded`.

Note that `payment_status` is used to group fees with a `succeeded` status into a specific invoice if `regroup_paid_fee` is set to `invoice`. Outside of this process, the `payment_status` is for your internal use.

## Delete a fee

<Info>
  The deletion of a fee can only be doable if `lago_invoice_id` is `null`.
</Info>

This option allows you to delete a fee that is not linked to any invoice. Please refer to charge [invoiceable or not](/guide/plans/charges/invoiceable-vs-noninvoiceable) for more details.
