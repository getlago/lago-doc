## Delete a billing entity

Deleting a billing entity is **not available** via the Dashboard or API.
To delete a billing entity, please contact the Lago team directly.

## Assign a billing entity to a customer

When creating a customer, you can assign it to a billing entity in two ways:

- Through the Dashboard by selecting the billing entity.
- Via API by passing the `billing_entity_code` in the customer creation payload.

If no billing entity is specified via API, the customer will automatically be assigned to the **default** billing entity to avoid breaking changes.

> ⚠️ A customer can only be linked to one billing entity.
>  
> If you need the same customer under a different billing entity, we recommend creating a new customer.

Once a customer is linked to a subscription, invoice, coupon, or wallet, **you cannot change their billing entity**.
