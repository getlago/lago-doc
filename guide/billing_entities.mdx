<Warning>
  The Billing Entities feature is currently in development. Not all functionality described in this documentation is fully available yet. We are actively working on expanding this feature.
</Warning>

<Info>
  All organizations must have at least one billing entity. Additional billing entities are available as a premium feature. The default entity for an organization is the oldest active billing entity, and it will be used for requests if no billing entity is provided.
</Info>

## Overview[](#overview "Direct link to heading")

Billing entities are instances that enable organizations to:
- Have different configurations for different customers
- Generate invoices with different settings based on the assigned billing entity
- Customize invoice generation rules per customer segment
- Maintain separate billing configurations for different business units or customer types

## Default Behavior[](#default-behavior "Direct link to heading")

<Info>
  If no billing entity is specified for a customer, the organization's default billing entity will be used automatically.

## Best Practices[](#best-practices "Direct link to heading")

1. **Use meaningful codes**: Choose billing entity codes that are easy to identify and understand
2. **Plan your structure**: Consider your customer segments and business units when creating billing entities
3. **Document configurations**: Keep track of the different configurations used across billing entities
4. **Regular review**: Periodically review billing entity assignments to ensure they still meet your business needs
5. **Default entity**: Maintain a well-configured default billing entity for new customers

- Each customer can only be assigned to one billing entity at a time
- Billing entity configurations cannot be changed retroactively for existing invoices
- Some settings may be restricted based on your subscription plan
- Billing entity changes may require customer notification depending on your business rules
