description: "Connect Lago live data, models, and billing logic to any AI system, bringing billing context and interactions everywhere."
---

The [Lago MCP Server](https://github.com/getlago/lago-agent-toolkit) (Model Context Protocol) is written in Rust and provides AI assistants (like Claude) with direct access to Lago's billing data. 
The server acts as a bridge between AI models and the Lago API, enabling natural language queries about invoices, customers, and billing information.

## Quick start using Claude Desktop

### Configure Claude Desktop
The easiest way to get started is using the pre-built Docker image with Claude Desktop:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lago": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--name", "lago-mcp-server",
        "-e", "LAGO_API_KEY=your_lago_api_key",
        "-e", "LAGO_API_URL=https://api.getlago.com/api/v1",
        "getlago/lago-mcp-server:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Set your credentials
Simply replace your `LAGO_API_KEY` with your actual Lago API key. You can find this in your Lago dashboard under API settings.
Also, make sure that you are using the right `LAGO_API_URL` for your Lago instance.

### Start chatting
Once configured, you can ask Claude natural language questions about your billing data:
- "Show me all pending invoices from last month"
- "Find all failed payment invoices"
- "Give me the total amount of overdue invoices for the month of March 2025"

The list of available commands and their descriptions can be found in the [Lago MCP Server GitHub repository](https://github.com/getlago/lago-agent-toolkit?tab=readme-ov-file#available-tools).
You can contribute to the project by adding more commands or improving existing ones.
