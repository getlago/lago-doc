  **Stripe Integration Only**
  
  While Lago supports multiple payment providers, payment pre-authorization is currently only available with Stripe.
</Warning>

## Introduction

By default, when creating a subscription, Lago follows this process:

1. Creates and activates the subscription (unless scheduled for the future or it's a downgrade);
2. Generates the invoice asynchronously; and
3. Processes the payment asynchronously.

This means it's possible to create an active subscription for a customer even if the payment later fails. While this behavior is intentional, it may not be ideal for all use cases.

To address this, Lago now offers payment pre-authorization, **allowing you to verify the validity of a payment method for a specific amount before creating the subscription.**

<Info>
**Important**: If the pre-authorization fails, the entire process is aborted and no subscription is created.
</Info>

## How pre-authorization Works

Pre-authorization creates a Payment Intent in Stripe to verify that the payment amount can be collected. When successful, the amount is temporarily held on the customer's account but not captured. 

**Note**: The held funds are automatically released immediately after successful verification.

Pre-authorization can fail for several reasons:

- Invalid card details;
- Insufficient funds; and
- 3D Secure authentication requirement.

Please note that if 3D Secure authentication is required, it may prevent subscription creation.

## Understanding the limitations

While pre-authorization helps reduce payment failures, it cannot guarantee successful invoice payment because:

1. Conditions may change between pre-authorization and actual payment:
   - Customer's account balance may decrease
   - Card may be blocked or expired
2. A bank might approve the pre-authorization but still require 3D Secure authentication for the actual payment

## Implementation guide

To implement pre-authorization, use the `POST /api/v1/subscriptions` endpoint with additional parameters. The standard `subscription` parameters remain unchanged.

You must manually specify the amount to authorize, as the final amount (including taxes) is only calculated during invoice generation.

### Request format

```json
{
  "authorization": {
    "amount_cents": 100,    // Amount in cents (e.g., 100 = 1 EUR)
    "amount_currency": "EUR"
  },
  "subscription": {
    // Standard subscription parameters
  }
}
```
