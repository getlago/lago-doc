  "Connect Lago to any payment providers by using native integrations or webhook messages."

Lago helps you monitor usage and calculates how much each customer owes you. However, **Lago is not a payment service provider (PSP)**.

## Payment collection process
To collect payments from your customers, you can:
- Use our native integrations with [GoCardless](/guide/payments/gocardless-integration), [Stripe Payments](/guide/payments/stripe-integration) or [Adyen](/guide/payments/adyen-integration); or
- Use the [webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks/messages) sent by Lago to transmit billing information to your PSP (e.g. Paddle, Razorpay, Authorize.net, internal ledger, etc.).

Lago is **agnostic**, which means that you can use our billing solution with any PSP.

## Payment status
When payments are processed through one of our native integrations, the payment status of the invoice is **automatically updated**.

  <Tab title="Dashboard">
      If needed, you can update the payment status via the user interface:
      1. Access the **"Invoices"** section;
      2. Select an invoice from the list;
      3. Open the **"Actions"** dropdown menu in the upper right corner;
      4. Click **"Update payment status"**;
      5. Select the new payment status; and
      6. Click **"Update status"** to confirm.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">
  This action can be performed [via the API](/api-reference/invoices/update) as well by changing the `payment_status` argument.
  ```bash Update a payment status of an invoice
  LAGO_URL="https://api.getlago.com"
  API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"

  curl --location --request PUT "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/invoices/{__INVOICE_ID__}" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    "invoice": {
      "payment_status": "succeeded",
      "metadata": [
        {...}
      ]
    }
  }'
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Handling one-off payments
Lago offers a streamlined solution for handling exceptional payment situations through its one-off payment checkout feature. 
This is particularly useful when automatic payment processes face issues, resulting in invoices with `pending` or `failed` statuses.

- **Instant checkout link generation:**
For any troubled invoice, Lago enables you to generate a unique checkout link. This link can be shared with the user to facilitate an immediate payment of that invoice.

- **Automatic payment method storage:**
Lago captures and stores the payment method used in the one-off transaction. This ensures that future payments are processed more smoothly.

- **Real-time payment status update:**
The status of the invoice is updated in real time once the payment is successfully processed.

<Info>
Currently, this feature is only supported for Adyen and Stripe native integrations with Lago.

## Record manual payments
For manual or non–Lago-native payment methods, you can record payments via the API or UI. 
Both partial and full payments can be recorded; however, an invoice’s payment status will only update to `succeeded` when it is fully settled.

To record a payment:
1. Navigate to an unpaid invoice;
2. Click the "Record Payment" button;
3. Select the payment date;
4. Enter the payment reference;
5. Specify the payment amount (partial or full); and
6. Confirm to record the payment.
