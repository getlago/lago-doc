## Receipt object

Payment receipts include (but are not limited to):

- Receipt number;
- Payment date;
- Customer information;
- Payment amount;
- Remaining due payment amount;
- Reference to impacted invoices; and
- Fees, taxes and total amount.

You can **download receipts** or use the receipt object to create your own receipt template.

## Multiple receipts per invoice

An invoice can have multiple receipts associated with it, especially in cases where:

- Partial payments are made over time; or
- Manual payments are recorded alongside automatic payments.

This flexibility allows you to accurately track all payments made towards an invoice, maintaining a clear audit trail of the payment history.

<Tip>
  For accounting and compliance purposes, Lago maintains the integrity of finalized invoices by never modifying them. Instead, payment receipts track all payment activities and remaining balances.

## Downloading receipts

You can download payment receipts directly from the payment details page in the Lago dashboard.

## Receipt email notifications

Lago automatically sends email notifications containing the payment receipt and the corresponding invoices to the customer's email address when a payment is processed. This ensures that your customers have immediate access to their payment documentation and can easily track their payment history.

1. Go to **Settings** in the Lago dashboard;
2. Select the **Emails** tab;
3. Find the "Payment receipt" email scenario; and
4. Toggle the switch to enable email notifications for payment receipts.

Once enabled, customers will automatically receive an email with their payment receipt and corresponding invoices whenever a payment is processed.
