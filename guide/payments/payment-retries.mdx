title: "Payment retries"
---

Whether you use one of our native integrations or rely on our
[webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks/messages) to collect payments, you have the ability to
manually resend payments for collection when needed.

To re-trigger the payment process through the user interface:

1. Access the **"Invoices"** section via the side menu;
2. Open the **"Outstanding"** tab;
3. Find the invoice for which you would like to collect payment;
4. Click the **ellipsis icon** on the right; and
5. Select **"Resend for collection"**.

In the **"Outstanding"** and **"Overdue"** tabs of the **"Invoices"** section, you can also
click **"Resend for collection"** in the upper right corner to re-trigger the
payment process for all invoices in the respective lists.

<Info>
  Invoices that are overdue are available both on the **"Outstanding"** and the
  **"Overdue"** tabs. Make sure you resend for collection from the **"Overdue"**
  tab if you wish to collect payment for past due invoices only.
</Info>

When a payment is resent for collection, an `invoice.created` or
`invoice.add_on_added` webhook is automatically sent, depending on the type of
invoice.

In addition to this, if the default payment provider for the customer is
[Stripe](/guide/payments/stripe-integration),
[GoCardless](/guide/payments/gocardless-integration) or [Adyen](/guide/payments/adyen-integration), Lago will automatically process
the payment through integration.

It is also possible to trigger payment retries via the API
([learn more](/api-reference/invoices/retry.mdx)).
