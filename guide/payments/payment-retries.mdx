## Retry an invoice payment
Whether you use one of our native integrations or rely on our
[webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks/messages) to collect payments, you have the ability to
manually resend payments for collection when needed.

To re-trigger the payment process through the user interface:

1. Access the **"Invoices"** section via the side menu;
2. Open the **"Outstanding"** tab;
3. Find the invoice for which you would like to collect payment;
4. Click the **ellipsis icon** on the right; and
5. Select **"Resend for collection"**.

In the **"Outstanding"** and **"Overdue"** tabs of the **"Invoices"** section, you can also
click **"Resend for collection"** in the upper right corner to re-trigger the
payment process for all invoices in the respective lists.

<Info>
  Invoices that are overdue are available both on the **"Outstanding"** and the
  **"Overdue"** tabs. Make sure you resend for collection from the **"Overdue"**
  tab if you wish to collect payment for past due invoices only.
</Info>

When a payment is resent for collection, an `invoice.created` or
`invoice.add_on_added` webhook is automatically sent, depending on the type of
invoice.

In addition to this, if the default payment provider for the customer is one of the native integrations supported by Lago, we will automatically process
the payment through integration.

It is also possible to trigger payment retries via the API
([learn more](/api-reference/invoices/retry)).

## Generate a payment url
If youâ€™re using a payment provider integration, you can generate a payment URL [for unpaid invoices](/api-reference/invoices/payment-url) or [unpaid wallet transactions](/api-reference/wallets/wallet-transaction-payment-url) to share with the end customer. 
This URL initiates a checkout flow where the customer can pay the invoice or wallet transaction by providing a payment method.

To prevent duplicate payments, the generated URL is idempotent. It remains valid and unchanged for 24 hours, regardless of how many times the endpoint is called. 
After this period, a new URL will be issued upon the next call to the endpoint, valid for the following 24 hours.
