## Payments in India
Cashfree is a leading payment platform in India, offering an end-to-end suite of payment and payout products tailored to the country's needs. 
Its extensive coverage of payment methods—including credit/debit cards, net banking, UPI, and popular wallets like Paytm, PhonePe, and Amazon Pay—enables businesses to seamlessly collect payments from Indian customers with minimal friction.
This integration streamlines the collection of Lago invoices in India by leveraging multiple local payment methods.

## Connect Cashfree to Lago

To connect Cashfree to Lago, navigate to your Lago UI, then go to **Integrations** > **Built by community**, and add a new **Cashfree Payments** connection:

1. Click **Add a connection**.
2. Type a connection **name**.
3. Type a unique connection **code**.

## Create a webhook endpoint
<Tip>
    To complete this process, you will need:

    - Your Lago **organization ID**, available in the **"API keys & ID"** tab of the
    **"Developers"** section;
    - The **connection code** you created during the Cashfree setup process.
</Tip>

If you want Lago to automatically retrieve the status of the payments processed
via Cashfree Payments, you must create a webhook endpoint in Cashfree. To do so:

1. Log in to your Cashfree Payments account;
2. Add the following Webhook URL in the **Webhooks** > **Payment Link** section of the Cashfree Payments dashboard;
3. Enter the following URL: `https://api.getlago.com/webhooks/cashfree/{{__YOUR_ORG_ID__}}?code={{__YOUR_CONNECTION_CODE}}` (you must replace `organization_id` with your Lago organization ID, and the `connection_code` by the targeted Lago connection); and
4. Save the creation of this webhook endpoint.

## Collect payments via Cashfree

### Connect a Lago Customer to Cashfree
To begin collecting payments for your Lago invoices via Cashfree, you need to link a Lago customer to a Cashfree connection. 
When creating or editing a customer in Lago, simply select the relevant Cashfree connection under **external apps** to enable invoice payments.

### Generate a checkout link
Note that payments through Cashfree does not automatically proceed when Lago generates an invoice. You need to programmatically generate a checkout link by calling the [following endpoint](/api-reference/invoices/payment-url):

```bash Request
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.getlago.com/api/v1/invoices/{lago_id}/payment_url \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

By generating this checkout link, you can forward it to your customer to complete payment using their preferred method from India. Once the payment is processed, Lago automatically retrieves the invoice status from Cashfree.

```json Response
{
  "invoice_payment_details": {
    "lago_customer_id": "13b901a90-1a90-1a90-1a90-1a901a901a90",
    "lago_invoice_id": "1e501a90-938s-1a90-1a90-1a901a901a80",
    "external_customer_id": "53dj371e-4ea2-bcf9-57d3a41bc6ba",
    "payment_provider": "cashfree",
    "payment_url": "https://cashfree.payment_link"
  }
}
```

### Cashfree payment errors
If an error occurs during the Cashfree payment process for a Lago invoice, Lago sends a [`payment_request.payment_failure`](https://docs.getlago.com/api-reference/webhooks/messages#param-payment-request-payment-failure) webhook containing the error details.
