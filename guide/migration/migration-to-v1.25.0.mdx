title: "Migration to v1.25.0"
---

Dear Lago Community, ðŸ‘‹

We're writing to inform you about important changes in Lago v1.25.0 that will enhance performance and enable new features.

# Why are we doing this?

We are making these changes to:
1. Improve performance by populating the existing `organization_id` field on fees for historical data, which will optimize database queries
2. Enable new features by adding `billing_entity_id` to fees, which will support upcoming functionality

# What are the changes?

## 1. Populating `organization_id` on fees

While the `organization_id` field already exists on fees, we need to populate it for historical data to improve query performance and prepare for upcoming features. This change requires a data migration to populate the field for existing fees.

## 2. Adding `billing_entity_id` to fees

We're introducing the `billing_entity_id` field to fees to support new features in the pipeline. This change also requires a data migration to populate the field for existing fees.

# What should self-hosted users do?

<Note>
Cloud users do not need to follow these instructions, as the migration will be performed by the Lago Team.
</Note>

## Migration Steps

1. Install the new version of Lago (v1.25.0)
2. Open the Rails console on your API server:
   ```bash
   rails c
   ```
3. Run the following commands in sequence:

   a. Populate organization_id from invoices:
   ```ruby
   DatabaseMigrations::PopulateFeesWithOrganizationFromInvoiceJob.perform_later
   ```
   Wait for all jobs in Sidekiq to be executed.

   b. Populate organization_id from subscriptions:
   ```ruby
   DatabaseMigrations::PopulateFeesWithOrganizationFromSubscriptionJob.perform_later
   ```
   Wait for all jobs in Sidekiq to be executed.

   c. Verify that all fees have organization_id:
   ```ruby
   Fee.where(organization_id: nil).count
   ```
   This should return 0.

   d. Populate billing_entity_id:
   ```ruby
   DatabaseMigrations::PopulateFeesWithBillingEntityIdJob.perform_later
   ```
   Wait for all jobs in Sidekiq to be executed.

   e. Verify that all fees have billing_entity_id:
   ```ruby
   Fee.where(billing_entity_id: nil).count
   ```
   This should return 0.

# Timeline

We recommend performing this migration as soon as possible after the release of v1.25.0 to ensure optimal performance and access to new features.
