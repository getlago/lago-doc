title: "Migration to v1.29.0"
---

Dear Lago Community, ðŸ‘‹

Weâ€™re writing to inform you of upcoming changes in the Lago API that may impact your workflows.

## TLDR;

Deprecation on **November 12, 2025** of:

- `PUT /organization` endpoint
- `applied_to_organization` field in `POST /taxes`
- `applied_to_organization` field in `PUT /taxes`

<Warning>
	If youâ€™re using a version below `v1.20.0`, please first follow the migration steps for [v1.20.0](/guide/migration/migration-to-v1.20.0), then for [v1.25.0](/guide/migration/migration-to-v1.25.0), then for [v1.28.1](/guide/migration/migration-to-v1.28.1). 
	Only after completing those should you proceed to v1.29.0.
</Warning>

## Why are we doing this?

In our continuous efforts to improve Lagoâ€™s scalability and flexibility, we are updating our API to streamline the delivery of multiple features. 
This approach allows us to deliver more value to you and will pave the way for an exciting release of supporting multiple billing entities within a single Lago account.

## Timeline

We will maintain the current API logic untilÂ **November 12, 2025**. However, after this date, previous versions will no longer be supported. 
We kindly ask you to update your integration before that day to avoid any potential breaking change.

## What are the changes

### 1. From `PUT /organization` to `PUT /billing_entities/{code}`

**Impact:**

- Introducing `PUT /billing_entities/{code}`
- Deprecating `PUT /organization`

In the initiative of supporting multiple billing entities within a single Lago account, the organization object wonâ€™t carry any invoicing settings and information. 
To update them youâ€™ll have to target the `PUT /billing_entities/{code}`.

```diff "PUT /organization"
{
-  "organization": {
-    "webhook_url": "https://webhook.brex.com",
-    "country": "US",
-    "address_line1": "100 Brex Street",
-    "address_line2": null,
-    "state": "NYC",
-    "zipcode": "10000",
-    "email": "brex@brex.com",
-    "city": "New York",
-    "legal_name": null,
-    "legal_number": null,
-    "net_payment_term": 30,
-    "tax_identification_number": "US123456789",
-    "timezone": "America/New_York",
-    "default_currency": "USD",
-    "document_numbering": "per_customer",
-    "document_number_prefix": "LAGO-INV",
-    "email_settings": [
-      "invoice.finalized",
-      "credit_note.created"
-    ],
-    "billing_configuration": {
-      "invoice_footer": "This is my customer footer",
-      "invoice_grace_period": 3,
-      "document_locale": "en",
-      "vat_rate": 12.5
-    }
-  }
}
```

```diff "PUT /billing_entities/code"
{
+  "billing_entity": {
+    "country": "US",
+    "address_line1": "100 Brex Street",
+    "address_line2": null,
+    "state": "NYC",
+    "zipcode": "10000",
+    "email": "brex@brex.com",
+    "city": "New York",
+    "legal_name": null,
+    "legal_number": null,
+    "net_payment_term": 30,
+    "tax_identification_number": "US123456789",
+    "timezone": "America/New_York",
+    "default_currency": "USD",
+    "document_numbering": "per_customer",
+    "document_number_prefix": "LAGO-INV",
+    "email_settings": ["invoice.finalized", "credit_note.created"],
+    "invoice_footer": "This is my customer footer",
+    "invoice_grace_period": 3,
+    "document_locale": "en",
+    "tax_codes": []
  }
}
```

### 2. From `applied_to_organization` field in `POST|PUT /taxes` to `PUT /billing_entities/{code}`

**Impact:**

- Introducing `PUT /billing_entities/{code}`
- Deprecating `applied_to_organization` in `POST /taxes` and `PUT /taxes`

In the initiative of supporting multiple billing entities within a single Lago account, the organization object wonâ€™t carry any invoicing settings and information. 
You wonâ€™t be able to apply a tax to the organization anymore, youâ€™ll have to add these values to a targeted billing entity using `PUT /billing_entities/{code}`.

```diff "PUT /organization"
{
  "tax": {
    "lago_id": "1a901a90-1a90-1a90-1a90-1a901a901a90",
    "name": "TVA",
    "code": "french_standard_vat",
    "description": "French standard VAT",
    "rate": 20,
-   "applied_to_organization": true,
    "created_at": "2023-07-06T14:35:58Z"
  }
}
```

```diff "PUT /billing_entities/code"
{
	"billing_entity": {
	  "country": "US",
	  "address_line1": "100 Brex Street",
	  "address_line2": null,
	  "state": "NYC",
	  "zipcode": "10000",
	  "email": "brex@brex.com",
	  "city": "New York",
	  "legal_name": null,
	  "legal_number": null,
	  "net_payment_term": 30,
	  "tax_identification_number": "US123456789",
	  "timezone": "America/New_York",
	  "default_currency": "USD",
	  "document_numbering": "per_customer",
	  "document_number_prefix": "LAGO-INV",
	  "email_settings": ["invoice.finalized", "credit_note.created"],
	  "invoice_footer": "This is my customer footer",
	  "invoice_grace_period": 3,
	  "document_locale": "en",
+	  "tax_codes": []
	}
}
```
