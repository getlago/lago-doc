title: "Migration to v1.28.1"
---

Dear Lago Community, ðŸ‘‹

We're writing to inform you about important changes in Lago v1.28.1 that will enhance data consistency and prepare for upcoming features.

# Why are we doing this?

We are making these changes to:
1. Ensure data consistency by aligning `billing_entity_sequential_id` with `organization_sequential_id` in invoices
2. Prepare for upcoming features that will rely on consistent sequential IDs across the system

# What are the changes?

## Populating `billing_entity_sequential_id` in invoices

We're introducing a data migration to ensure that `billing_entity_sequential_id` matches `organization_sequential_id` for all invoices. This change will maintain data consistency and prepare the system for future enhancements.

# What should self-hosted users do?

<Note>
Cloud users do not need to follow these instructions, as the migration will be performed by the Lago Team.
</Note>

<Warning>
If you're upgrading to v1.28.1, you must complete all the migration steps below to ensure data consistency and proper functionality.
</Warning>

## Migration Steps

1. Install the new version of Lago (v1.28.1)
2. Open the Rails console on your API server:
   ```bash
   rails c
   ```
3. Run the following command:

   <Note>
   All invoices are processed in background jobs, with 1000 invoices per batch. You can monitor the progress in the Sidekiq console by checking the batch number argument in the job details.
   </Note>

   ```ruby
   DatabaseMigrations::PopulateInvoicesBillingEntitySequentialIdJob.perform_later
   ```
   Wait for all jobs in Sidekiq to be executed.
   <Note>
   Expected processing speed is at least 1-2 seconds per 1K invoices. The actual time may vary depending on your system's resources and database size.
   </Note>

   You can verify that the job is fully executed by running:
   ```ruby
   Invoice
     .where("organization_sequential_id != 0 AND billing_entity_sequential_id IS NULL")
     .or(Invoice.where("organization_sequential_id != 0 AND billing_entity_sequential_id != organization_sequential_id"))
     .count
   ```
   This should return 0 when all invoices have been processed.

# Timeline

We recommend performing this migration as soon as possible after the release of v1.28.1 to ensure optimal performance and access to new features.

# Get involved
