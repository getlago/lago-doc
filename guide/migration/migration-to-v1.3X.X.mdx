title: "Migration to v1.3X.X"
---

Dear Lago Community, ðŸ‘‹

We're writing to inform you about important changes in Lago v1.3X.X that will enhance data consistency. application performances and prepare upcoming features.

# What are the changes?

## Filling `organization_id` on every tables of the application

The `organization_id` column was recently added on every tables related to an organization.
Since filling this column is an heavy task, no migration was backfiling it for existing records. It was only populated on newly created records.

As we now need to be able to rely on this column in this application, we have to make sures that every single record as an `organization_id` value.

# Why are we doing this?

These changes are made to increase the performannces of the application, and to ease the development on future features.

# What should self-hosted users do?

<Note>
Cloud users do not need to follow these instructions as the migration will be performed by the Lago Team.
</Note>

<Warning>
If youâ€™re using a version below `v1.20.0`, please first follow the migration steps for [v1.20.0](/guide/migration/migration-to-v1.20.0), then for [v1.25.0](/guide/migration/migration-to-v1.25.0), then for [v1.28.1](/guide/migration/migration-to-v1.28.1), then for [v1.29.0](/guide/migration/migration-to-v1.29.0).

## Migration Steps

1. Install the Lago version 1.29.0
2. Open a shell (bash) on your API server
3. Run the migration task:

```bash
bundle exec rails migrations:fill_organization_id
```

  The task will:
  - Check for all database table to identify the ones that require a migration
  - Enqueue jobs to backfill the values
  - Loop over all migrating tables until all records are updated

  <Note>
  All resources are processed in background jobs, with 1000 records per batch.
  The task will monitor the values and give you the number of remaing records.
