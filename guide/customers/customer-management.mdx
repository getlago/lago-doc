Once a customer is created, you can access the customer view, where you can edit their information.

<Warning>
  You cannot change the `external_id` and the `currency` of customers after an object has been
  assigned to them (i.e. plans, coupons, one-off invoices, wallet and credits).
</Warning>

## Assign objects to a customer[](#assign-objects-to-a-customer "Direct link to heading")

The usage monitoring and billing processes start when you assign a plan to a
customer, which triggers a [subscription](/guide/subscriptions/assign-plan).

You can also apply [coupons](/guide/coupons), [one-off invoices](/guide/one-off-invoices/create-one-off-invoices) and
[prepaid credits](/guide/prepaid-credits) to a customer account.

To assign objects to a customer through the user interface:

1. Access the **"Customers"** section via the side menu;
2. Select a customer from the list;
3. In the upper right corner of the customer view, click **"Actions"**; and
4. Select an action from the dropdown list.

## Monitor the customer's current usage[](#monitor-the-customers-current-usage "Direct link to heading")

When a plan that includes usage-based charges is assigned to a customer, you can
start pushing [events](/guide/events/ingesting-usage) associated with the customer account.

During the billing period, the customer's current usage is visible in the
**"Usage"** tab of the customer view, including (but not limited to):

- Total amount for the period under consideration; and
- Breakdown by charge, including total number of billing units and amount.

  <Tab title="API">
   You can retrieve the customer's current usage via the API using [this endpoint](/api/customer-usage/get-current).
      <CodeGroup>
        ```bash Get customer current usage
            LAGO_URL="https://api.getlago.com"
            API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"
            EXTERNAL_CUSTOMER_ID="5eb02857-a71e-4ea2-bcf9-57d3a41bc6ba"
            EXTERNAL_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="sub_1234567890"

            curl --location --request GET "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/customers/$EXTERNAL_CUSTOMER_ID/current_usage?external_subscription_id=$EXTERNAL_SUBSCRIPTION_ID" \
            --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
            --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
        ```
      </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>

## Deleting a customer
You may delete a customer linked to existing objects (i.e. applied coupons, wallets, subscriptions, add-ons).

If you do so:
- All [subscriptions](/guide/subscriptions/assign-plan) associated with this customer account will be immediately terminated (this action may trigger the generation of invoices and/or credit notes);
- All [coupons](/guide/coupons) applied to this customer account will be immeditely terminated;
- The customer's active [wallet](/guide/prepaid-credits) will be immediately terminated and all remaining credits will be voided; and
- All `draft` invoices associated with this customer account will be immediately finalized.

`finalized` invoices and [credit notes](/guide/credit-notes) associated with the deleted customer remain available in the **"Invoices"** section of the user interface and can also be retrieved via the API.

It is possible to generate new credit notes and process refunds after the deletion of the customer.

<Info>
After deleting a customer account, you can create a new one using the same `external_id`.
