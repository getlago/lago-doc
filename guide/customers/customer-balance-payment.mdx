When a customer has some invoices past their due date, their [overdue balance](https://docs.getlago.com/guide/customers/customer-management#monitor-the-customers-billing-status) becomes positive, and you have the ability to request its payment manually.

    By clicking on it, a panel opens so you can:
    - Review the invoices included in the overdue balance,
    - Review the email which will be sent in case the payment fails, or if no payment provider is linked
    - Confirm you want to request the payment.
