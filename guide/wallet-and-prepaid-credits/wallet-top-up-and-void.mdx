## Credit purchases and top-ups[](#credit-purchases-and-top-ups "Direct link to heading")

Lago automatically generates an invoice for each purchase. Taxes do not apply to
credit purchases, which are considered as advance payments.

Payment must be made in order for credits to be added to the customer's wallet
(i.e. the status of the invoice must be `succeeded`).

## Invoicing top-up after successful payment option

When enabled, this option delays issuing an invoice for a wallet top-up until a successful payment is made. If disabled, the invoice is issued immediately upon the wallet top-up, regardless of the payment status.
This setting can be applied to individual transactions.

## Void credits[](#void-credits "Direct link to heading")

You can deduct a specific number of credits from the wallet's balance. Note that this action is instantaneous and cannot be undone.

## Setup recurring top-ups

When creating or editing a wallet, you have the option to enable recurring top-ups. Two methods for recurring top-ups are available: `fixed` and `target`. These can be triggered either based on an `interval` or a `threshold`.

### Fixed recurring top-up

A fixed recurring top-up allows you to add a predetermined number of credits to your wallet, either for purchasing or gifting.

### Target recurring top-up

A target recurring top-up allows you to add a variable amount of credits to your wallet to reach a specific target balance. The top-up amount is determined by the ongoing balance at the trigger moment and the desired target balance.

### Interval trigger

For an `interval` trigger, specify the frequency of the automatic top-up: `weekly`, `monthly`, `quarterly` or `yearly`.

Once the interval is defined, the system will automatically perform a top-up:

- Weekly, on the same day each week (e.g., every Monday).
- Monthly, on the same date each month (e.g., every 2nd of the month).
- Quarterly, on the same date every three months (e.g., every 2nd of the quarter).
- Yearly, on the same date every year (e.g., every 2nd of January).

### Threshold trigger

With a `threshold` trigger, set a specific number of `credits` that will trigger an automatic top-up. Lago monitors the `ongoing balance`, and if it falls below the defined credit threshold, an automatic top-up is initiated.
