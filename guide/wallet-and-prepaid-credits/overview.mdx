Prepaid credits increase predictability as they allow you to collect payments in advance and then monitor the evolution of the balance of your customer’s wallets.

    Free credits are added to the customer's wallet instantly, while purchased
    credits are added to the wallet when payment is confirmed (see below).

    Each customer can only have one active wallet.

## Real time wallet balance[](#real-time-wallet-balance "Direct link to heading")

<Info>

**PREMIUM FEATURE** ✨

This feature is only available to users with a premium license. Please
**[contact us](mailto:hello@getlago.com)** to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago
Self-Hosted Premium.

</Info>

Keep track of your wallet's real-time balance. Lago provides two types of balances for your wallet:

1. **Balance:** invoiced balance, which reflects the remaining prepaid credits in your wallet. It updates each time an invoice is finalized for the customer.
2. **Ongoing Balance:** balance accounted for current usage, including taxes and draft invoices offering a real-time estimate of your balance's consumption. It refreshes every 5 minutes or upon the finalization of an invoice for the customer.

## Application scope[](#application-scope "Direct link to heading")

Prepaid credits are deducted from the subtotal of the next invoice(s), after
tax.

![Invoice partially paid with prepaid credits](/guide/images/prepaid-credits-invoice-ecd9e8ad653b516efb08c6b48e1e48fe.png)

<Info>Prepaid credits do not apply to one-off invoices.</Info>

## Invoicing after successful payment option

When enabled, this option delays issuing an invoice for a wallet top-up until a successful payment is made. If disabled, the invoice is issued immediately upon the wallet top-up, regardless of the payment status. This setting applies to all transactions for the wallet, but can be overridden for individual transactions or recurring rules.

## Expiration date and termination[](#expiration-date-and-termination "Direct link to heading")

By default, if you don't set an expiration date, prepaid credits are carried
over to the next billing period until the wallet balance is zero.

If you define an expiration date, when the date is reached, all remaining
credits are **automatically voided**.

To modify the expiration date of the prepaid credits through the user interface:

1. Open the **"Wallets"** tab and click **"Edit wallet"** on the right;
2. Select **"Edit information"**;
3. Modify the expiration date; and
4. Click **"Edit information"** to confirm.

The expiration date displayed in the app is based on the organization's timezone.

You also have the ability to terminate a wallet manually, before its expiration
date:

1. Open the **"Wallets"** tab and click **"Edit wallet"** on the right;
2. Select **"Terminate wallet"**; and
3. Click again to confirm.

<Warning>
  Terminating a wallet will instantly void all remaining credits. This action
  **cannot be undone**.
</Warning>
