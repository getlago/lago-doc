In a billing system, entitlements define what a customer can access and how much they can use, based on their subscription or contract. 
This includes feature gates, which control whether a feature is enabled or disabled for a given customer; feature privileges, which determine the level of access within a feature, such as basic or advanced functionality; allowances, which represent the included usage in a plan, like 100 API calls per month; and quotas, which are the maximum usage limits that may trigger overage charges or access restrictions. Together, these components help enforce product limits, manage access, and support accurate usage-based billing.


In addition to the usage-based engine for allowances and quotas, Lago lets you define Features and Entitlements.

## Set up your features
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
      Lago supports the creation of any type of feature to tailor your billing logic. To create a new feature:

        1. Navigate to the **Features** section in the sidebar;
        2. Click on **Add a Feature** to start a new entry;
        3. Give it a unique `code` (used for programmatic actions) and a `name`;
        4. Assign one or more **privileges** to the feature (optional); and
        5. Click **Create feature** to finalize and save the feature to your instance.

      A feature in Lago represents a capability that can be gated behind a plan. It's not necessarily something you bill for directly, but rather something a customer gains access to based on their subscription.

## Define feature privileges

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    Additionally, you can define privileges for a specific feature. Privileges allow you to configure more granular access controls across different plans. For example, the invite_member feature might allow inviting 1 member on the *Free plan*, while offering unlimited invites on the *Pro plan*.

    Feature privileges can be associated with the following types:
    - **`boolean`** – The privilege value is either `true` or `false`.
    - **`integer`** – The privilege value is a numeric limit (e.g., `10 GPUs`).
    - **`string`** – The privilege value is freeform text.
    - **`select`** – The privilege value is chosen from a predefined list of options.

    At this stage, you're only defining the **type** of each privilege. The actual values will be set later, when the feature is entitled to a specific plan or subscription.

    <Info>
      You can add an unlimited number of privileges to a feature.

  <Tab title="API">
      <CodeGroup>
      ```test
      ```
      </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Assign features to plans
Once your features have been created, they can be added to your plans through a process called **Entitlements**. 

Entitlements define which features a customer is allowed to use based on the plan they are subscribed to. By assigning features to specific plans, you control access to functionality across your pricing tiers.

</Frame>

To assign features to a plan:

1. Create a new plan or edit an existing one;
2. Navigate to the **Advanced Settings** section;
3. Select the features you want to entitle for that plan; and
4. Configure the values for each feature's privileges according to the plan's rules.

## Override entitlements for a subscription
Some customers may subscribe to a standard plan but negotiate custom entitlements as part of their contract.

Just like charges, **you can override any entitlement value** for a specific subscription. This creates an **overridden subscription**, where the custom entitlements apply **only** to that particular customer, without affecting the base plan or other subscribers.


## Get entitlements for a subscription
You can retrieve the current list of entitled features for a subscription by calling the following endpoint:

```bash
GET /api/v1/subscriptions/:subscription_external_id/entitlements
```
