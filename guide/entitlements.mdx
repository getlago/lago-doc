In a billing system, entitlements define what a customer can access and how much they can use, based on their subscription or contract. 
This includes feature gates, which control whether a feature is enabled or disabled for a given customer; feature privileges, which determine the level of access within a feature, such as basic or advanced functionality; allowances, which represent the included usage in a plan, like 100 API calls per month; and quotas, which are the maximum usage limits that may trigger overage charges or access restrictions. Together, these components help enforce product limits, manage access, and support accurate usage-based billing.


In addition to the usage-based engine for allowances and quotas, Lago lets you define Features and Entitlements.

## Set up your features
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
      Lago supports the creation of any type of feature to tailor your billing logic. To create a new feature:

        1. Navigate to the **Features** section in the sidebar;
        2. Click on **Add a Feature** to start a new entry;
        3. Give it a unique `code` (used for programmatic actions) and a `name`;
        4. Assign one or more **privileges** to the feature (optional); and
        5. Click **Create feature** to finalize and save the feature to your instance.

      A feature in Lago represents a capability that can be gated behind a plan. It's not necessarily something you bill for directly, but rather something a customer gains access to based on their subscription.

  <Tab title="API">
      <CodeGroup>
      ``` bash Create a feature
      curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.getlago.com/api/v1/features \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '{
      "code": "seats",
      "name": "Number of seats",
      "description": "Number of users that can be added to the account"
    }'
      ```
      </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Define feature privileges

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    Additionally, you can define privileges for a specific feature. Privileges allow you to configure more granular access controls across different plans. For example, the invite_member feature might allow inviting 1 member on the *Free plan*, while offering unlimited invites on the *Pro plan*.

    Feature privileges can be associated with the following types:
    - **`boolean`** – The privilege value is either `true` or `false`.
    - **`integer`** – The privilege value is a numeric limit (e.g., `10 GPUs`).
    - **`string`** – The privilege value is freeform text.
    - **`select`** – The privilege value is chosen from a predefined list of options.

    At this stage, you're only defining the **type** of each privilege. The actual values will be set later, when the feature is entitled to a specific plan or subscription.

    <Info>
      You can add an unlimited number of privileges to a feature.

      --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '{
      "code": "seats",
      "name": "Number of seats",
      "description": "Number of users that can be added to the account",
      "privileges": [
        {
          "code": "max_",
          "name": "Maximum seats",
          "value_type": "integer"
        },
        {
          "code": "min",
          "name": "Minimum seats",
          "value_type": "integer"
        },
        {
          "code": "allow_admin_user",
          "name": "Allow admin user",
          "value_type": "boolean"
        }
      ]
    }'
      ```
      </CodeGroup>

## Map entitled deatures to your plans

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    Once your features have been created, they can be added to your plans through a process called **Entitlements**. 
    This is where you define features that are unlocked for a specific plan and the limits, values or privileges for each feature.

    Entitlements define which features a customer is allowed to use based on the plan they are subscribed to. By assigning features to specific plans, you control access to functionality across your pricing tiers.

    <Frame caption="Subscription and entitlement workflow">
        <img src="/guide/images/entitlements-subscription-workflow.jpg" />
    </Frame>

    To assign features to a plan:

    1. Create a new plan or edit an existing one;
    2. Navigate to the **Advanced Settings** section;
    3. Select the features you want to entitle for that plan; and
    4. Configure the values for each feature's privileges according to the plan's rules.

    <Frame caption="Entitle features to a plan">
        <img src="/guide/images/plans-entitlements.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">
      <CodeGroup>
      ``` bash Create plan entitlements
      curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.getlago.com/api/v1/plans/{code}/entitlements \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '{
      "seats": {
        "max": 20,
        "min": 10,
        "allow_admin_user": false
      },
      "sso": {
        "provider": "okta"
      }
    }'
      ```
      </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Override entitlements for a subscription

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    Some customers may subscribe to a standard plan but negotiate custom entitlements as part of their contract.

    Just like charges, **you can override any entitlement value** for a specific subscription. 
    This creates an **overridden subscription**, where the custom entitlements apply **only** to that particular customer, without affecting the base plan or other subscribers.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">
      <CodeGroup>
      ``` bash Create subscription entitlements
    curl --request PATCH \
      --url https://api.getlago.com/api/v1/subscriptions/{external_id}/entitlements \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '{
      "seats": {
        "max": 30,
        "min": 20,
        "allow_admin_user": true
      },
      "sso": {
        "provider": "okta"
      }
    }'
      ```
      </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Get entitlements for a subscription
You can retrieve the current list of entitled features for a subscription by calling the following endpoint:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.getlago.com/api/v1/subscriptions/{external_id}/entitlements \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```
You can also track entitlement changes through the `subscription.updated` webhook.
