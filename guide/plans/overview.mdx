apply prices to this usage."

Note that you don't need to define a Billable metric to create a Plan. However,
if you have usage feature to charge, the price of your Billable metrics is
defined inside each Plan. Make sure to understand
[how to create a Billable metric](/guide/billable-metrics/create-billable-metrics) first.

## Plan structure[](#plan-structure "Direct link to heading")

A Plan defines the features your customers have access to, the prices paid to
access them and the invoicing cadence. In order to invoice a Customer with Lago,
you must assign a Plan to a customer.

**But first, let's define the structure of a Plan:**

<Tabs>
   <Tab title="Dashboard">
      1. [The Plan basic informations](#plan-structure)
         - A Plan `name`
         - A Plan `code`
         - A Plan `description`
      2. [The Plan model](/guide/plans/plan-model)
         - A Plan `interval`
         - A Plan base `amount` with the `currency`
         - Boolean to define if the Plan is paid **in advance** or **in arrears**
         - A Plan `trial period` in days
         - Taxes applied to this plan
      3. [The additional charges](/guide/plans/charges) for this Plan (any Billable metrics
         that have been created)
         - A Charge `model`
         - A Charge `amount` and its `currency` (automatically inherited from the
         currency of the Plan)
         - A Charge spending minimum
         - Boolean to define if the Charge is paid **in advance** or **in arrears**
         - Taxes applied to this charge (overriding the one defined on the plan)

## Editing and deleting Plans[](#editing-and-deleting-plans "Direct link to heading")

Plans can be fully edited as long as they are not linked to a customer (i.e., no active [subscription](/guide/subscriptions/assign-plan) for this Plan). Once a plan is associated with a customer, you can modify the prices related to subscriptions or charge fees, but other settings (such as "plan's interval", “pay in advance”, pro-rated charges …) will no longer be editable.

To update the plan’s settings, you will need to either remove all active subscriptions or create a new plan.

If you want to update a specific charge, you must remove it from the plan and then re-add it with the updated details.
