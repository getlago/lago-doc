## Custom invoice grouping[](#invoice-grouping "Direct link to heading")

Grouping invoice line items in a way that provides clearer insight for your customers can be more beneficial than sticking to the default charge setup in Lago.
For instance, as an AI service provider, you might prefer to regroup all fees associated to one charge by a specific `model` used by a customer, without the need to individually list each model in Lago.
When setting up a charge with a `standard` charge model, you can use `model_name` as an event property in the `grouped_by` attribute. If every event reported to Lago includes a `model_name`, Lago is capable of adjusting your invoice so that charges are organized under the respective model name for that particular charge. Consequently, Lago will also automatically allocate the usage costs for each model.
You can specify multiple `grouped_by` keys for your charge; the order you set them in dictates how they will be displayed on the invoice, affecting the presentation of charges.

<Note>
The `grouped_by` feature is exclusively available for the `standard` charge model.
