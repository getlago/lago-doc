<Note>

Only the `sum` aggregation type is compatible with the `dynamic` charge model.
If you have a different use case, please reach out to the Lago team for assistance.

</Note>

Select the dynamic charge model if you calculate the price manually or if prices fluctuate during a billing period (e.g., for SMS APIs, AI models, etc.), and you want to apply a specific **total amount** per event using the property `precise_total_amount_cents`.

Letâ€™s take the example of our AI company. You may want to charge a custom price per event. Consider the following list of events:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Table view">
    | Event         | Metric             | Unit | Total amount |
    | ------------- | ------------------ | ---- | ------------ |
    | Transaction 1 | Dedicated Instance | 7    | $0.70        |
    | Transaction 2 | Dedicated Instance | 5    | $0.55        |
    | Transaction 3 | Dedicated Instance | 10   | $2.20        |  
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Events payload">
      <CodeGroup>
      ```bash List of events
      {
        "events": [
          {
            "transaction_id": "transaction_1",
            "external_subscription_id": "123456789",
            "code": "dedicated_instance",
            "timestamp": 1728554400,
            "precise_total_amount_cents": "70",
            "properties": {
              "unit": "7"
            }
          },
          {
            "transaction_id": "transaction_2",
            "external_subscription_id": "123456789",
            "code": "dedicated_instance",
            "timestamp": 1728558000,
            "precise_total_amount_cents": "55",
            "properties": {
              "unit": "5"
            }
          },
          {
            "transaction_id": "transaction_3",
            "external_subscription_id": "123456789",
            "code": "dedicated_instance",
            "timestamp": 1728561600,
            "precise_total_amount_cents": "220",
            "properties": {
              "unit": "10"
            }
          }
        ]
      }'
      ```
      </CodeGroup>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

At the end of the period, the invoice will generate **one fee of $3.435** (see example bellow).

| Item               | Unit | Unit price | Amount |
| ------------------ | ---- | ---------- | ------ |
| Dedicated Instance | 22   | $0,156818  | $3.45  |
