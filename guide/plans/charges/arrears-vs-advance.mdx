title: "Arrears vs Advance"
description:
  "Usage-based charges can be either charged in advance or in arrears"
---

You have the flexibility to define the nature of charges associated with your products or services. Specifically, you can 
**determine whether a charge has to be paid in arrears (at the end of the period), or in advance (immediately on event ingestion)**.


## Charges paid in arrears[](#charges-arrears "Direct link to heading")
If you opt for charges to be settled in arrears, they will be invoiced at the end of the billing period based on 
the actual usage during that period. This payment option is ideal for usage types like storage, API calls, or compute, 
where it is more practical to wait until the end of the period before billing. By default, all charges are configured to be 
billed in arrears.
