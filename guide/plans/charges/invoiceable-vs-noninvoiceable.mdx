  **Premium feature ✨**: only users with a premium license can define whether
  or not a charge is invoiceable. Please **[contact

  Self-Hosted Premium.

If a charge needs to be `paid in advance`, you can choose whether or not it generates an invoice.

The `"invoiceable": false` option is **particularly relevant for fintech companies that want to charge customers instantly
without issuing an invoice**. This feature can be useful for banking transactions like ATM withdrawals, FX transfers and other
similar scenarios.

By setting the invoiceable parameter to false, a fee is created by default, and a webhook `fee.created` is sent immediately upon any changes in usage without generating an invoice. However, you can configure the charge invoicing strategy via `regroup_paid_fees`:

1. `null`: Fees generated never appear on invoices (default behaviour).
2. `invoice`: Groups all paid fees into one invoice at the end of the billing period.

Please note that if `invoice`, all fees generated with a `payment_status` different from `succeeded` won’t appear on invoice generated at the end of the billing period. They will appear on next ones if you manually edit their `payment_status` to `succeeded`.

The invoice generated consolidates paid fees, is marked as paid, and will not be emailed to your end customer if the email feature is activated.
