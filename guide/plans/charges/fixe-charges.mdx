## Overview of charges[](#overview-of-charges "Direct link to heading")
Fixed charges let you bill recurring fees that are not based on usage.
They are tied to [add-ons](/guide/one-off-invoices/create-add-ons) and sit outside the event stream.

Common examples include platform fees, seat licenses, or support packages.
Unlike usage-based charges, fixed charges are billed as a fixed recurring amount.

The units defined on the fixed charge are used by Lago to generate the fee on the invoice.

## Charge models and billing behavior[](#charge-models "Direct link to heading")
Fixed charges support a limited set of pricing options compared to usage-based charges.
They can use:
- [Standard](/guide/plans/charges/charge-models/standard) or [graduated](/guide/plans/charges/charge-models/graduated) pricing models

They can be configured to:
- Be billed [in advance or in arrears](/guide/plans/charges/arrears-vs-advance)
- Be billed [in full or prorated](/guide/plans/charges/prorated-vs-full)

## Currency[](#charges-currency "Direct link to heading")
All fixed charges use the same currency as the plan, ensuring consistency across invoices.


## Trial period[](#trial-period-exclusion "Direct link to heading")
Trial periods apply only to the plan’s base amount.
Fixed charges are always billed, even during a trial.

## Decimals precision[](#number-of-decimals "Direct link to heading")
Fixed charges can be defined with up to 15 decimal places (for example: \$0.000123456789123).
Fixed charges are invoiced in `amount_cents`, so Lago automatically rounds values when generating invoices (for example, USD 1102 `amount_cents` \= \$11.02).

## Edit a fixed charge[](#edit-fixed-charge "Direct link to heading")
When editing a fixed charge, you can edit the amount and the unit already defined. You can choose when unit changes should apply:
- **Apply now**: The new unit value is applied immediately. If the fixed charge is billed in advance, this may trigger invoice issuance.
- **Apply at next billing period**: The new unit value is applied at the start of the subscription’s next billing period.

This gives you control over whether changes impact current or future billing.

<Info>
  Editing a fixed charge unit may generate invoices when the charge is billed in advance and changes are applied immediately.  
  Customers will receive an invoice reflecting this update.

## Delete a fixed charge[](#delete-fixed-charge "Direct link to heading")
You can delete a fixed-charge even if the plan is associated to active [subscriptions](/guide/subscriptions/assign-plan).

Once deleted and saved:

- The fixed-charge is immediately removed from all linked subscriptions
- It is removed from all `draft` invoices.

However, the fixed-charge will still appear on invoices `finalized` before the deletion.

## Invoice display name[](#invoice-display-names "Direct link to heading")
You can customize, during plan creation or edition, how a fixed-charge appears on invoices by setting an `invoice display name`.
This name overrides the default fixed-charge name and is shown everywhere invoices are displayed.
