You will be prompted to provide an optional Name. While naming the key is not mandatory, it is highly recommended to make it easier to identify later. Once created, the API key will be ready for immediate use.

Whenever a new API key is created, all organization admins are notified via email. The key becomes active and usable instantly.

## Roll an API key

With this feature, you can schedule an API key roll for a future time. Options include rolling the key `now`, in `1 hour`, `24 hours`, `48 hours`, or `7 days`. By hovering over the current API key, you can view the scheduled roll time.

Whenever an API key is rolled, all organization admins receive an email notification. The newly generated key becomes active and ready for use immediately, while the previous key remains available until the scheduled roll time is reached.


## API key "Last used" field
For security purposes, a Last used field displays the last time this API key was accessed. This serves as a helpful indicator to determine if the key is still actively in use.
