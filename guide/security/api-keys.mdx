## Reveal an API Key
By accessing the **Developers > API Keys** section, you can click the **Reveal** button to display an API key of your organization. 
For security reasons, the key can only be copied when it is visible.

## API Key "Last Used" Field
For security purposes, a **Last Used** field displays the last time this API key was accessed. This serves as a helpful indicator to determine if the key is still actively in use.


## Rotate an API Key
By accessing the **Developers > API Keys** section, you can click the **Roll API Key** button to generate a new API key. 

When an API key is rotated, all organization admins receive an email notification about the change. 
Expired keys are removed from the UI and become unusable.
