# Authentication Methods

Lago supports multiple login methods. You can manage which ones are available to your users, and optionally enforce a specific method for your organization.

---

## Available login methods

- **Password login**  
  Default email and password authentication.

- **Google login**  
  Sign in with a Google account (OAuth-based).

- **Okta SSO**  
  Sign in via SAML using Okta.

---

## Enforcing a login method

You can enforce a single login method for your entire organization.

When enforcement is active:

- All other login methods are disabled
- Users must sign in using the required method
- New invites will only work with the enforced method

> **Example**: If you enforce Okta SSO, Google and password login will be disabled.

### To enforce a method:
1. Go to **Settings > Authentication**
2. Find the method you want to enforce (e.g. Okta)
3. Click the action menu (`⋮`)
4. Select **Set as required**

### To remove enforcement:
1. Go to **Settings > Authentication**
2. Find the enforced method
3. Click the action menu (`⋮`)
4. Select **Remove requirement**

This will re-enable previously available login methods.

## Enabling or disabling a login method

You can enable or disable individual login methods (e.g. password login or Google login) at any time. Only **one method must remain enabled**.

Even if a method is disabled, it will still appear on the login page (which is shared across organizations).  
However, users attempting to log in via a disabled method will see an error message and won't be able to continue.

### To disable a method:
1. Go to **Settings > Authentication**
2. Find the method you want to disable (e.g. Google)
3. Click the action menu (`⋮`)
4. Select **Disable this method**

The method will still appear on the login screen but will not be usable for your organization.

### To enable a method:
1. Go to **Settings > Authentication**
2. Find the method you want to re-enable
3. Click the action menu (`⋮`)
4. Select **Enable this method**

The method will become available again for users in your organization.

> ⚠️ At least one login method must remain enabled at all times.

## Edge cases

- A user trying to log in with a disabled method will receive an error message.
- You do **not** need to reinvite users when changing authentication settings. As long as they use the same email, their account remains linked.
