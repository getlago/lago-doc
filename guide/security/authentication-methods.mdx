# Authentication Methods

Lago supports multiple login methods. You can manage which ones are available to your users, and optionally enforce a specific method for your organization.

---

## Available login methods

- **Password login**\
  Default email and password authentication.
- **Google login**\
  Sign in with a Google account (OAuth-based).
- **Okta SSO**\
  Sign in via SAML using Okta.

---

## Enforcing a login method

You can enforce a single login method for your entire organization. When enforcement is active:

- All other login methods are automatically disabled
- Users must sign in using the required method
- New invites will only work with the enforced method

To update enforcement:

1. Go to **Settings \> Authentication**
2. Find the method you want to enforce or un-enforce
3. Click the action menu (`⋮`)
4. Select **Set as required** or **Remove requirement**, depending on the current state

> Example: If you enforce Okta SSO, Google and password login will be disabled.\
> You can remove enforcement at any time to re-enable other methods.

---

## Enabling or disabling a login method

You can enable or disable individual login methods (e.g. password login or Google login) from the **Settings \> Authentication** page. Only one method must remain enabled at all times.

To update a method:

1. Find the method you want to change
2. Click the action menu (`⋮`)
3. Select **Enable this method** or **Disable this method**, depending on its current state

> Note: Even when a method is disabled, it will still appear on the login page (which is shared across organizations).\
> If a user tries to log in with a disabled method, they will receive an error message and won’t be able to proceed.

## Edge cases

- You do **not** need to reinvite users when changing authentication settings. As long as they use the same email, their account remains linked.
