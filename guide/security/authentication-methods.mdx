title: "Authentication Methods"
description: "Lago supports multiple login methods. You can manage which ones are available to your users, and choose to enforce one as required."
---

## Available login methods

- **Password login**  
  Default email and password authentication.

- **Google login**  
  Sign in with a Google account (OAuth-based).

- **Okta SSO**  
  Sign in via SAML using Okta.

---

## Enforce a login method

You can enforce a single login method for your entire organization.  
When enforcement is active:

- All other login methods are disabled
- Users must sign in using the required method
- New invites will only work with the required method

> **Example**: If you enforce Okta SSO, Google and password login will be disabled.

---

## Enable or disable methods

You can manually enable or disable methods like password login and Google login in **Settings > Authentication**.  
Okta SSO is only available if the integration is configured.

> ⚠️ At least one login method must remain active at all times.

---

## Remove enforcement

You can remove enforcement at any time. This re-enables all previously allowed methods.

---

## Edge cases

- A user who previously used a now-disabled method will not be able to log in.
- You don’t need to reinvite users. Their identity stays the same as long as they use the same email.
