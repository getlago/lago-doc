## Activity logs
Activity logs provide a record of actions initiated within your organization, including actions performed through the UI, via the API, or triggered automatically by the system (e.g., automated billing operations).


### Activity logs retention
Access to the activity log is limited to paid tiers:
1. Free users do not have access to activity logs;
2. Premium users can view activity logs for up to 30 days; and
3. Enterprise customers with the appropriate paid add-on can access the full activity log history without time limits.

- **Description**: A brief explanation of the activity;
- **Activity ID**: A unique identifier for the activity log entry;
- **Resource Type**: The type of object affected (e.g., `Wallet`, `Invoice`, `Customer`);

  - `front` – triggered from the UI
  - `api` – triggered from the API
