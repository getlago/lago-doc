## Admin role

Admins wield full control over Lago, managing billable metrics, plans, customers, subscriptions, settings or financial analysis.
Typically, developers with admin roles handle all critical billing operations. By default, the account creator is assigned the Admin role.

<Info>
  Only admins can invite new members and assign roles. Your account must always
  have at least one admin.
</Info>

## Account manager role

The Account manager role suits Sales or Customer Success Managers, enabling them to carry out billing tasks for customers.
Account Managers can assign subscriptions, coupons, add-ons, and override prices but are not permitted to modify metrics or plans.

## Finance & analyst role

The Finance & analyst role is view-only, restricted from creating or editing metrics and plans, or assigning core billing actions such as coupons,
subscriptions. It's ideal for analyzing financial data, reviewing invoices, and issuing credit notes as necessary.
