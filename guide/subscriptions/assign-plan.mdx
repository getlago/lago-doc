When a subscription is active, Lago will automatically generate invoices for the customer according to the [plan model](/guide/plans/plan-model). It will also start monitoring the customer's consumption, which means that you can start pushing [events](/guide/events/ingesting-usage) related to this subscription.

<Info>
The subscription date displayed in the app is based on the organization's timezone.

## Billing cycles
Optimize billing for your customers by assigning subscriptions based on either calendar dates or anniversary dates (the day they signed up).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Calendar billing period">
    By default, subscriptions are based on **calendar periods**. Therefore, if you assign a monthly plan to a customer on July 14th:
    - The first invoice will be generated for the period July 14th to July 31st;
    - The next invoice will be generated for the period August 1st to August 31st; and
    - All future invoices will be generated for full calendar months.

    When a subscription starts during the month, the subscription fee will be calculated on a **pro rata basis** according to the number of days.

    Consider the following example:

    >Your customer signs up for the Premium plan, \$50 monthly, on August 10th. There are 22 days left until the end of the month, including August 10th. Therefore, the subscription fee for August is:
    >**22 days x \$50 / 31 days = \$35.48**

  <Frame caption="Calendar billing cadence">
    <img src="/guide/subscriptions/images/calendar-date-227bf60245e9d3715d3383098c88c1b0.png" />
  </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Anniversary billing period">
    Another option is to use the **anniversary date** of the subscription to define a custom billing period.

      For example:
      >Your customer signs up for the Premium plan on August 10th.
      >If you choose to align the billing cycle with the anniversary date of the subscription, the customer will be billed every 10th of the month.
      >The first billing period will run from August 10th to September 9th.

## Subscription start date
By default, the subscription starts the day it is created. However, you can set a subscription date in the past or in the future. 
The subscription date displayed in the app is based on the organization's timezone.
However, you can decide to start a subscription **in the past** or **in the future**.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Start date in the past">
    If the start date of the subscription is in the past, the subscription is considered active.
    
    <Info>
    Lago will not generate any invoices for past periods already completed.
    </Info>

    The invoicing process varies depending on the [plan model](/guide/plans/plan-model) and [billing cycle](#billing-cycles):
    - If the plan includes a subscription fee to be paid in advance, it will be considered as **already paid for the current period**. The next invoice will include the usage-based charges for the current period and the subscription fee for the next period (see example 1 below); and
    - If the plan includes a subscription fee to be paid in arrears, it will be **included in the next invoice**, together with the usage-based charges for the current period (see example 2 below).

    **Example 1:** Start date in the past and subscription fee to be paid in advance
    <Frame caption="Illustration for start date in the past and subscription fee in advance">
      <img src="/guide/subscriptions/images/subscription-past-advance-0bedeeb9f9918608568ea7db6479e4ef.png" />

    <Frame caption="Illustration for start date in the past and subscription fee in advance">
      <img src="/guide/subscriptions/images/subscription-past-arrears-b4f22483b4ae3a358c0b27305e49a766.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Start date in the future">
    If the start date of the subscription is in the future, the subscription is considered pending.

    The invoicing process varies depending on the [plan model](/guide/plans/plan-model) and [billing cycle](#billing-cycles):
    - If the plan includes a subscription fee to be paid in advance, when the subscription becomes active, Lago will automatically generate an **invoice for the subscription fee**. Usage-based charges will be included in the next invoice, generated at the end of the billing period (see example 3 below); and
    - If the plan includes a subscription fee to be paid in arrears, when the subscription becomes active, **there will be no invoice**. The subscription fee and usage-based charges will be included in the invoice generated at the end of the billing period (see example 4 below).

    **Example 3:** Start date in the future and subscription fee to be paid in advance
    <Frame caption="Illustration for start date in the future and subscription fee in advance">

## Subscription end date
By default, if no subscription end date is specified, **the subscription will automatically renew at the end of the period**.

However, if you define an end date, the subscription will terminate on that date without renewal. This is valuable for contracts with specific termination dates.

Keep in mind, 45 days and 15 days before the subscription ends, a webhook alert, called `subscription.termination_alert`, will remind you. You then have two choices:
1. Allow the subscription to continue until the end date and finalize it; or
2. Adjust the subscription end date if the contract has been renegotiated.

<Info>
  Ensure that the subscription end date is set to a date later than the subscription start date.
</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
  Here is how you can define a susbcription end date from the UI:

    1. Access the **"Customers"** section via the side menu;
    2. Select a customer from the list;
    3. In the **"Overview"** tab, click **"Add a plan"** on the right;
    4. Set a subscription start date;
    5. Set a subscription end date;
    6. Choose between calendar or anniversary billing;
    7. Click **"Add plan"** to confirm.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">
  Use the `ending_at` field on the subscriptions endpoint.
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Define a subscription end date
    LAGO_URL="https://api.getlago.com"
    API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"

    curl --location --request POST "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/subscriptions" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \

        "billing_time": "anniversary"
      }
    }'
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Multiple plans
You may create several subscriptions for a customer by assigning them multiple plans. This can be particularly useful if your application allows customers to create different projects or workspaces (e.g. Free plan for Workspace 1, Free plan for Workspace 2, Premium plan for Workspace 3, etc.).

<Warning>
There are some rules to keep in mind when assigning multiple plans to a customer:
1. All plans must be denominated in the same currency; and
2. You must specify the `external_subscription_id` for each event or create [batch events](/api-reference/events/batch).
</Warning>

We recommend that you give each subscription a name when assigning multiple plans to a customer. The subscription names will make it easier to differentiate each plan and will also be displayed on the invoices.

When multiple subscriptions are linked to a customer, Lago will automatically consolidate invoices when possible.

|                  | Month 1 | Month 2 | Month 3 | Month 4 | (...) | Month 13 |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ----- | -------- |
| Plan A (monthly) | $40     | $40     | $40     | $40     | (...) | $40      |
| Plan B (monthly) | $60     | $60     | $60     | $60     | (...) | $60      |
| Plan C (yearly)  | $500    | -       | -       | -       | (...) | $500     |
| Total invoice    | $600    | $100    | $100    | $100    | (...) | $600     |

It is possible to link to the same customer subscriptions that are based on different billing cycles (e.g. a subscription based on calendar dates and another based on the anniversary date).

It's crucial to note that all overridden plans will remain associated with the initial plan but won't be visible in the plans list. 
To access an overridden plan, simply click on the specific subscription item in the customer details view.

Moreover, all invoices generated from this subscription will be based from the overridden plan, not the initial plan. 
Additionally, any coupons restricted to a plan code will apply to both the initial and overridden plans.

Importantly, any changes made to the initial plans will not impact the subscriptions linked to overridden plans.

## Deleting a plan
You could [delete a plan](/api-reference/plans/destroy) linked to existing subscriptions.

If you do so, the subscriptions associated with this plan will be immediately terminated. This action may trigger the generation of invoices and/or credit notes.

<Info>
After deleting a plan, you can create a new one using the same code.
