## Overdue balance payment
When a customer has some invoices past their due date, their [overdue balance](https://docs.getlago.com/guide/customers/customer-management#monitor-the-customers-billing-status) becomes positive, and you have the ability to request its payment manually.

    </Frame>

    By clicking on it, a panel opens so you can:
    - Review the invoices included in the overdue balance,
    - Review the email which will be sent in case the payment fails, or if no payment provider is linked
    - Confirm you want to request the payment.

  <Tab title="API">
      You can create a payment request for the overdue balance from the API, targeting the invoices you want to be paid.
      <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Create a payment request
      LAGO_URL="https://api.getlago.com"
      API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"

      curl --location --request POST "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/payment_requests/" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data-raw '{
