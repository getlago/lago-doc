<Info>
**PREMIUM ADD-ON** ✨

This revenue-share feature is available upon request only. Please **[contact us](mailto:hello@getlago.com)** to get access to this premium feature.
</Info>

If you’re selling your product or service through a partner, model this revenue-share in Lago. 
Mark your customer as a partner, and Lago will generate all invoices as self-billed invoices.


Self-billing is a billing arrangement where the customer creates and issues the invoice on behalf of the supplier for goods or services received. 
That said, **please own and ensure** an agreement is in place with your partner to allow Lago to issue these invoices on their behalf.

## Create a partner
To generate self-billed invoices, create your first partner by following these steps:
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    1. Go to the **Customers** navigation tab.
    2. Click on **Create a Customer**.
    3. Enable the **Partner** option by toggling it on.
    4. Fill in the customer’s billing information—this will be used to generate invoices.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">
  ```bash Create a customer
  LAGO_URL="https://api.getlago.com"
  API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"

    curl --location --request POST "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/customers" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
      "customer": {
        …
        "account_type: "partner",
        …
      }
    }'
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Generate invoices
To simplify your payment process, Lago will generate invoices on behalf of partners.

All invoices generated for a partner will be marked as **self-billed**. As a result, they won’t appear in revenue analytics in Lago.

The PDF invoice will explicitly mention **Self-billing Invoice** and will not be affected by the custom footer. 
A specific notice will be displayed to indicate that the invoice was generated on behalf of the partner with their consent.

These invoices follow a specific numbering system tied to the customer. 
Regardless of whether your organization’s invoice numbering is scoped per **organization** or **customer**, all partner invoices will adhere to the **partner invoice numbering**.
