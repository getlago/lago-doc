The first graph shows the total usage recorded over the selected time period. It provides an at a glance view of overall consumption patterns for usage based services. Usage is displayed as an aggregated total amount, allowing you to quickly understand how much usage has been recorded across all customers during that period.

The second graph provides a detailed view of metered and recurring metrics. You can select a specific metric to explore its consumption in more detail. Depending on your analysis needs, you can view either `unit` or `amount` to focus on the number of units consumed or the total amount billed.

### Time-based usage analysis
You can analyze usage data using different time groupings:
- **Daily**: View day-by-day usage breakdown
- **Weekly**: Aggregate usage data by week
- **Monthly**: See monthly usage trends and patterns
