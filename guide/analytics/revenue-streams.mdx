## Revenue streams overview
The Revenue Streams dashboard provides a detailed breakdown of your revenue across different sources, helping you understand your revenue composition and track growth over time. This view allows you to analyze how different revenue types contribute to your overall business performance.

The data shown in the dashboard is based on generated invoices, not on usage in the current billing period. The revenue stream dates are the invoices creation dates.
