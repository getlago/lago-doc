## MRR overview and breakdown
It's worth noting that Lago's MRR calculations solely pertain to `subscription` fees. Usage-based metrics,
whether recurring or metered, are not factored into the MRR calculations. This distinction ensures that your MRR figures
specifically reflect your subscription-based revenue, helping you gain a clear understanding of your core financial
performance.

### MRR breakout
The graph details the MRR flows for a selected time period. It includes the following elements:
- **New MRR:** The MRR generated from new subscriptions during the selected period.
