Below is a compilation of essential commands tailored for open-source enthusiasts, primarily designed for managing invoicing tasks,
whether for immediate processing or scheduling.

These commands are designed to execute a Rails console (rails c) within a Docker container named api, which is managed by Docker Compose.

```
docker-compose exec api rails c
```

## Dry-run invoice in the future

Use this to simulate a dry run invoice for a future date. Ensure to specify the correct subscription `external_id` and the targeted invoice issuance date.

```ruby
# In the rails Console
subscription = Subscription.find_by(external_id: 'YOUR_SUB_EXTERNAL_ID')
date = DateTime.parse('2024-10-01').to_i

BillSubscriptionJob.perform_later([subscription], date)
```

## Issue invoice immediately

Use this to issue an invoice immmediately. Ensure to specify the correct subscription `external_id` and the current date.

```ruby
# In the rails Console
subscription = Subscription.find_by(external_id: 'YOUR_SUB_EXTERNAL_ID')
timestamp = DateTime.parse('2024-04-01').to_i
BillSubscriptionJob.perform_now([subscription], timestamp, invoicing_reason: :subscription_periodic)
```

## Remove cache for a subscription
Use this to remove the cache on a specific subscription.

```ruby
# In the rails Console
Subscriptions::ChargeCacheService.expire_for_subscription(Subscription.find('YOUR_SUB_EXTERNAL_ID'))
```
To remove the cache for all subscriptions, you can alternatively use this command:
```ruby
# In the rails Console
Subscription.find_each {|s| Subscriptions::ChargeCacheService.expire_for_subscription(s) }
```
