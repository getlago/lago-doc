This document outlines the supported technologies and their versions for Lago self-hosted deployments. Use this matrix to ensure your infrastructure meets the requirements for your target Lago version.

## Core Dependencies by Version

| Lago Version | PostgreSQL | Redis | Valkey | Kubernetes | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ≥ 1.0 | 14+ | 6.2+ | 7.0+ | - | Safe baseline for existing installs |
| ≥ 1.30 | 15+ | 7.x | 7.2+ | - | Recommended for new installs |
| ≥ Latest Release | 15+ | 7.x | 7.2+ | 1.26+ | Production-grade setup |

<Info>
  **For PostgreSQL, the [pg_partman](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman) extension should be installed on the server.**

## Analytics & Streaming Dependencies

These components are required for specific Lago features.

| Category | Technology | Supported Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Analytics DB | ClickHouse | 25.6+ | Required for analytics features |
| Streaming | Redpanda | 25.2+ | Required for event streaming capabilities |

## Recommendations

**For new deployments**, we recommend starting with the latest supported versions:
- **PostgreSQL 15+** for full compatibility with recent Lago releases
- **Redis 7.x** or **Valkey 7.2+** for optimal performance and stability
- **Kubernetes 1.26+** if deploying with Helm charts

<Warning>
PostgreSQL 14 is supported for older Lago versions (≥ 1.0) but newer releases target PostgreSQL 15+. If you are running PostgreSQL 14, plan an upgrade before moving to Lago ≥ 1.30.
