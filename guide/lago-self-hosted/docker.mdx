  "Docker is the easiest way to get started with the self-hosted version of
  Lago."
---

## Requirements[](#requirements "Direct link to heading")

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine;
2. Make sure [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is
   installed and available (it should be the case if you have chosen to install
   Docker via Docker Desktop); and
3. Make sure
   [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) is
   installed on your machine.

## Run the Lago App

### Run the app with a one-click Docker command
You can start using the app by using a one-click Docker command in a shell:
```shell
docker run -d --name lago -p 80:80 -p 3000:3000 getlago/lago:latest
```
You can now open your browser and go to [http://localhost](http://localhost) to
connect to the application. Just after
[signing up](#signing-up), Lago's API is exposed
at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Run the app with advanced Docker commands

If you don't want to use the one-click Docker command, you can start using Lago by running more advanced commands in a shell:

```shell
# Get the code
git clone https://github.com/getlago/lago.git

# Go to Lago folder
cd lago

# Fetch all tags
git fetch --tags

# Get the latest tag and checkout
git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)

# Set up environment configuration
echo "LAGO_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY=\"`openssl genrsa 2048 | base64 | tr -d '\n'`\"" >> .env

source .env

# Start all the components
docker compose up
```

You can now open your browser and go to [http://localhost](http://localhost) to
connect to the application. Just after
[signing up](#signing-up), Lago's API is exposed
at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Signing up[](#signing-up "Direct link to heading")

It's mandatory to create your organization by signing up to Lago. This
organization is the core object of your biller as it's used to invoice your
customers.

1. Write down your `organization name`;
2. Use the main billing `email` of your company; and
3. Define the admin `password` for this email.

You will be able to **invite other email addresses within the application**. If
you already have an account, you can also log in. Once you are able to access
the app, you can retrieve your API key.

## Find your API Key[](#find-your-api-key "Direct link to heading")

Your API Key can be found directly in the UI:

1. Access the **Developer** section from the sidebar;
2. The first tab of this section is related to your **API keys**; and
3. Click the **Copy** button to copy it to clipboard.

## Configuration[](#configuration "Direct link to heading")

### Version[](#version "Direct link to heading")

Docker images are always updated to the last stable version in the
`docker-compose.yml` file. You can use a different tag if needed by checking the
[releases list](https://github.com/getlago/lago/releases).

<Warning>
  We recommend to avoid the usage of `latest` tag, you should use the last
  tagged version, you can track what are the last version on Dockerhub

### Environment variables[](#environment-variables "Direct link to heading")

Lago uses the following environment variables to configure the components of the
application. You can override them to customise your setup.

<Warning>
We recommend that you change `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `SECRET_KEY_BASE`,
`LAGO_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY`, `LAGO_ENCRYPTION_PRIMARY_KEY`,
`LAGO_ENCRYPTION_DETERMINISTIC_KEY` and `LAGO_ENCRYPTION_KEY_DERIVATION_SALT` to
improve the security of your Lago instance:

- `SECRET_KEY_BASE` can be generated using the `openssl rand -hex 64` command.
- `LAGO_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY` can be generated using the
  `openssl genrsa 2048 | base64` command.
- `LAGO_ENCRYPTION_PRIMARY_KEY`, `LAGO_ENCRYPTION_DETERMINISTIC_KEY` and
  `LAGO_ENCRYPTION_KEY_DERIVATION_SALT` can all be gerated using the
  `cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1` command.

</Warning>

### Components[](#components "Direct link to heading")

Lago uses the following containers:

| Container    | Role                                                                  |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `front`      | Front-end application                                                 |
| `api`        | API back-end application                                              |
| `api_worker` | Asynchronous worker for the API application                           |
| `api_clock`  | Clock worker for the API application                                  |
| `db`         | Postgres database engine used to store application data               |
| `redis`      | Redis database engine used as a queuing system for asynchronous tasks |
| `pdf`        | PDF generation powered by Gotenberg                                   |

You can also use your own database or Redis server. To do so, remove the `db`
and `redis` configurations from the `docker-compose.yml` file and update the
environment variables accordingly.

### SSL Support[](#ssl-support "Direct link to heading")

Lago Front application can be configured to support SSL certificates. You have
two options to achieve this:

- by using a self-signed certificate
- by using a signed certificate generated by Let's Encrypt

#### Self Signed Certificate[](#self-signed-certificate "Direct link to heading")

- Run the script to generate the certificates

```shell
# Be sure to be in your lago folder
./extra/init-selfsigned.sh

# This should create certificates in the ./extra/ssl/ folder
```

- Take a look at the `docker-compose.yml` file and uncomment the part related to
  the Self-Signed certificate

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./extra/nginx-selfsigned.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
  - ./extra/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.crt:/etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
  - ./extra/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.key:/etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key
  - ./extra/ssl/dhparam.pem:/etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem
```

- You can now start the front application with a self signed SSL certificate
  support

```shell
docker-compose up front
```

#### Let's Encrypt Certificate[](#lets-encrypt-certificate "Direct link to heading")

- Edit the file `extra/init-letsencrypt.sh`
  - You must replace `lago.example` with your domain name
  - You must enter a valid email address
- Edit the file `extra/nginx-letsencrypt.conf`
  - You must replace `lago.example` with your domain name
- Uncomment the [Cerbot lines](https://github.com/getlago/lago/blob/5d08b61f4f174f445b258005854aaa18ca049266/docker-compose.yml#L124-L129) in the `docker-compose.yml` file
- Run the following script

```shell
# Be sure to be in your lago folder
./extra/init-letsencrypt.sh

# You will be asked to provide some information
# After that you should be able to see the extra/certbot folder
```

- Take a look at the `docker-compose.yml` file and uncomment all the parts
  related to the Let's Encrypt's support

```yaml
command:
  '/bin/sh -c ''while :; do sleep 6h & wait $${!}; nginx -s reload; done & nginx
  -g "daemon off;"'''
---
volumes:
  - ./extra/nginx-letsencrypt.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
  - ./extra/certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt
  - ./extra/certbot/www:/var/www/certbot
```

- You can now start the front application with the signed certificate support

```shell
docker-compose up front
```

### Storage[](#storage "Direct link to heading")

By default, Lago uses the internal storage of the container. You can customize
it by defining different environment variables.

We currently support :

- AWS S3
- AWS S3 Compatibles Endpoints
- Google Cloud Service Cloud Storage

<Warning>
  If you use S3 compatibles endpoints, you should set the `LAGO_AWS_S3_REGION`
  to a default value (ei: `us-east-1`), it is required to work properly!
</Warning>

#### AWS S3[](#aws-s3 "Direct link to heading")

You have to set these variables to use AWS S3.

| Name                          | Description                             |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `LAGO_USE_AWS_S3`               | Set to "true" if you want to use AWS S3 |
| `LAGO_AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | AWS S3 Credentials Access Key Id        |
| `LAGO_AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS S3 Credentials Secret Access Key    |
| `LAGO_AWS_S3_REGION`            | AWS S3 Region                           |
| `LAGO_AWS_S3_BUCKET`            | AWS S3 Bucket                           |

| `LAGO_GCS_BUCKET`  | GCS Bucket name                                    |

In the `docker-compose.yml` file, you must uncomment the lines and pass the
correct GCS credentials json file.

```yaml
api:
  volumes:
    - gcs_keyfile.json:/app/gcs_keyfile.json

api-worker:
  volumes:
    - gcs_keyfile.json:/app/gcs_keyfile.json
```
