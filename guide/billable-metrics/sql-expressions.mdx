## Creating a SQL Custom Expression
When creating a billable metric, you can choose between using a simple aggregation field or a custom expression. 
**Custom expressions allow you to define more advanced computation logic**, which is useful when the required aggregation involves complex calculations that Lago should handle.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    To add a custom expression through the user interface:

    - Define the `name` and `code` for the billable metric;
    - Choose an aggregation type;
    - Select `Custom expressions` as the aggregation option instead of `Unique field`;
    - Enter your custom expression in the expanded side panel;
    - Test the custom expression; and
    - Save the billable metric.

      Here are few examples of custom expressions you can create for a billable metric:
      <CodeGroup>
      
    ```bash Storage {13}
      LAGO_URL="https://api.getlago.com"
      API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"

      curl --location --request POST "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/billable_metrics" \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-raw '{
          "billable_metric": {
            "name": "Storage",
            "code": "storage",
            "description": "Number of GB consumed",
            "aggregation_type": "sum_agg",
            "expression": "(event.properties.ended_at - event.timestamp) / 3600",
            "field_name": "total",
            "recurring": false
          }
        }'
    ```

    ```bash Seats {13}
      LAGO_URL="https://api.getlago.com"
      API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"

      curl --location --request POST "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/billable_metrics" \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-raw '{
          "billable_metric": {
            "name": "Seats",
            "code": "seats",

            "aggregation_type": "unique_count_agg",
            "expression": "concat(event.properties.user_id, ‘-‘ , event.properties.app_id)",
            "field_name": "total",
            "recurring": true
          }
        }'
    ```

<Info>
    Custom expressions can be used with any aggregation type except `COUNT`.

## Examples of SQL Custom Expressions
A variety of SQL custom expressions are available for use. Here are a few examples:

- **Concatenation:** `CONCAT(value1, '_', value2)`
- **Math operations:** `((value1 * value2) / value3)`
- **Rounding:** `ROUND(value1 / value2)`

If you need a SQL custom expression that isn't supported by default in Lago, **feel free to contact our team** or **consider contributing to the open-source version**.


## Testing your SQL Custom Expression
Lago provides a testing tool to help you validate the custom expressions you've created. A sample event is used to test your expression. You can override any field in the test event.
If your custom expression is incorrect, Lago will return an error, and you won't be able to save it until it's valid.

Keep the following in mind:
- You can dynamically reference any event field within your expression; and
- Use precise paths to reference fields accurately. For instance, to use the event timestamp, the path is `event.timestamp`. To reference a custom property sent with the event, the path is `event.properties.your_field`.
