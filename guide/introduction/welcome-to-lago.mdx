title: "Welcome to Lago"
description: "Lago is an open-source software for metering and usage-based billing. It's the best alternative to Chargebee, Recurly or Stripe Billing for companies that need to handle complex billing logic."
---

This library will allow you to build an entire billing system from scratch. Lago is a real-time, event-based solution made for usage-based billing, subscription-based billing, and all the nuances of pricing in between.

You can use the [self-hosted version](/guide/self-hosted/docker) to deploy Lago on your existing infrastructure or [request access to Lago Cloud](https://getlago.com/book-a-demo) to start using our solution immediately.

## Five-step billing workflow[](#five-step-billing-workflow "Direct link to heading")

### 1. Usage ingestion[](#1-event-ingestion "Direct link to heading")

[Events](/guide/events/ingesting-usage) provide information about your customers'
consumption, with the highest level of granularity. Any product feature for
which you want to charge your customers should correspond to a specific event.
An event can be triggered by an action or can be sent periodically. Lago is able
to ingest events at scale while preventing duplicates.

### 2. Metrics aggregation[](#2-metrics-aggregation "Direct link to heading")

The aggregation process consists in converting events into
[billable metrics](/guide/billable-metrics/create-billable-metrics). There are 4 aggregation types:

| Aggregation       | Description                                                                                            | Type                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| `COUNT`           | Counts the number of times an incoming event occurs                                                    | Metered               |
| `COUNT_UNIQUE`    | Returns the number of unique values of a predefined property for incoming events                       | Metered or Recurring  |
| `LATEST`          | Returns the lastest value of a predefined property for incoming events                                 | Metered               |
| `MAX`             | Returns the maximum value of a predefined property for incoming events                                 | Metered               |
| `SUM`             | Calculates the sum of a predefined property for incoming events                                        | Metered or Recurring  |
| `WEIGHTED SUM`    | Calculates the sum of a predefined property for incoming events prorated based on time used per period | Metered or Recurring  |




### 3. Pricing and packaging[](#3-pricing "Direct link to heading")

Creating [plans](/guide/plans/overview) allows you to define how much your customers
should pay for using your product. You can then combine plans and billable
metrics to implement any billing model (i.e. subscription-based, usage-based, or
hybrid). Billable metrics may be priced differently depending on the associated
plan.

### 4. Invoicing[](#4-invoicing "Direct link to heading")

Lago automatically generates [invoices](/guide/invoicing/overview) for each customer
according to the plan model: the subscription fee can be billed at the beginning
or at the end of the billing period while usage-based charges are always
calculated at the end of the billing period. Invoices include fees, taxes and
customer information.

### 5. Payments[](#5-payments "Direct link to heading")

When an invoice is emitted and finalized, it's ready for payment collection.
Connect payment providers through [native integrations](/guide/payments/overview) or
trigger payments on any PSPs using the invoice payload created by Lago.
