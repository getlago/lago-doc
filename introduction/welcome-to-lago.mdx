title: "Welcome to Lago"

Lago is an **open-source software for metering and usage-based billing**. It's
the best alternative to Chargebee, Recurly or Stripe Billing for companies that
need to handle complex billing logics.

This library will allow you to build an entire billing system from scratch. Lago
is a real-time, event-based solution made for usage-based billing,
subscription-based billing, and all the nuances of pricing in between.

You can use the [self-hosted version](/docker) to deploy Lago on your existing
infrastructure or
[request access to Lago Cloud](https://forms.gle/eT7zgqcvq8dgt94g7) to start
using our solution immediately.

## Five-step billing workflow[](#five-step-billing-workflow "Direct link to heading")

### 1\. Event ingestion[](#1-event-ingestion "Direct link to heading")

[Events](/ingesting-events) provide information about your customers'
consumption, with the highest level of granularity. Any product feature for
which you want to charge your customers should correspond to a specific event.
An event can be triggered by an action or can be sent periodically. Lago is able
to ingest events at scale while preventing duplicates.

### 2\. Metrics aggregation[](#2-metrics-aggregation "Direct link to heading")

The aggregation process consists in converting events into
[billable metrics](/overview). There are 5 aggregation types:

| Aggregation     | Description                                                                      | Type      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| COUNT           | Counts the number of times an incoming event occurs                              | Metered   |
| SUM             | Calculates the sum of a predefined property for incoming events                  | Metered   |
| MAX             | Returns the maximum value of a predefined property for incoming events           | Metered   |
| COUNT DISTINCT  | Returns the number of unique values of a predefined property for incoming events | Metered   |
| RECURRING COUNT | Add and remove billing units that are persisted period over period               | Persisted |

- **Metered**: aggregated for a single billing period and resume to 0 at the end
  of the billing period.
- **Persisted**: aggregated for a billing period and kept in-memory for
  following periods, unless you change the value.

### 3\. Pricing[](#3-pricing "Direct link to heading")

Creating [plans](/plans/overview) allows you to define how much your customers
should pay for using your product. You can then combine plans and billable
metrics to implement any billing model (i.e. subscription-based, usage-based, or
hybrid). Billable metrics may be priced differently depending on the associated
plan.

### 4\. Invoicing[](#4-invoicing "Direct link to heading")

Lago automatically generates [invoices](/invoicing/overview) for each customer
according to the plan model: the subscription fee can be billed at the beginning
or at the end of the billing period while usage-based charges are always
calculated at the end of the billing period. Invoices include fees, taxes and
customer information.

### 5\. Payments[](#5-payments "Direct link to heading")

When an invoice is emitted and finalized, it's ready for payment collection.
Connect payment providers through [native integrations](/payments/overview) or
trigger payments on any PSPs using the invoice payload created by Lago.
