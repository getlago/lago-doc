## Pricing structure

Segment offers three pricing plans, called 'Free', 'Team' and 'Business'. As the latter has a custom pricing, we will focus on the first two plans.


| Plan          | Free plan     | Team plan     |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Subscription Fee | $0/month    | $120/month   |
| Base Consumption (included) | 1,000 MTUs | 10,000 MTUs |
| Consumption (10k-25k MTUs) | n/a         | $0.012/month/MTU |
| Consumption (25k-100k MTUs) | n/a        | $0.011/month/MTU |
| Consumption (100k+ MTUs)     | n/a        | $0.010/month/MTU |
| Trial Period  | n/a           | 14 days       |

The usage-based component in Segment's pricing is related to **monthly tracked users (MTUs)**, namely the number of unique users whose data is stored on the platform each month.
As these are **unique users**, we must ensure that each user is counted only once during the billing process.

Now let's see how we can implement Segment's pricing plans using Lago.

## Step 1- Keep track of unique users

Segment has implemented a graduated pricing model, based on the number of MTUs.
| MTUs           | Price                  |
|----------------|------------------------|
| 10k-25k MTUs  | $0.012/unit            |
| 25k-100k MTUs | $0.011/unit            |
| 100k+ MTUs    | $0.010/unit            |

Therefore, we need to calculate the number of unique users in order to implement our second pricing plan.

  <Tab title="Dashboard">

    We are going to use a billable metric, which will allow us to aggregate incoming events on the platform to measure consumption.

    We have created a billable metric, called **Monthly Tracked Users**, which includes the **`user_id` property**. In addition to this, we have defined `unique_count_agg` as the aggregation type.

    What does this mean? Every time the customer data platform (e.g. Segment) records a new activity, a `mtu` event will be sent to Lago, which will then use the `user_id` property to deduplicate users to get only the total number of unique ones.

  <Tab title="API">
    ```bash Create a metric tracking unique users
    LAGO_URL="https://api.getlago.com"
    API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"

    curl --location --request POST "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/billable_metrics" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
        "billable_metric": {
            "name": "Monthly Tracked Users",
            "code": "mtu",
            "aggregation_type": "unique_count_agg",
            "weighted_interval": null,
            "recurring": false,
            "field_name": "user_id",
            "filters": []
        }
    }'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2- Create a plan with tiers
It's time to create our **Team plan**. The subscription part is similar to the 'Free plan' (except that the amount is now $120). We can also add the 14-day free trial currently offered by Segment.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    To charge customers for consumption (i.e. based on MTUs), we need to add a charge to our plan.
    Using the `mtu` billable metric created previously, we have implemented the graduated pricing model to reproduce Segment's pricing, including 10,000 free units (i.e. 10,000 unique users).

    Following this example, for a customer on the 'Team' plan with 30,000 MTUs, at the end of the month, their invoice will amount to:
    - $120 (first 10,000 MTUs)
    - $180 (next 15,000 MTUs)
    - $55 (last 5,000 MTUs)

    Our pricing plan is now ready!

## Step 3- Ingest usage for unique users in real-time
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    For every user accessing Segment's platform, an event is dispatched containing the `user_id` property. Lago seamlessly handles deduplication to ensure accurate tracking of unique users.
