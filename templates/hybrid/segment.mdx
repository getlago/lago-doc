## Pricing structure

Segment offers three pricing plans, called 'Free', 'Team' and 'Business'. As the latter has a custom pricing, we will focus on the first two plans.

| Plan          | Free plan     | Team plan     |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Subscription Fee | $0/month    | $120/month   |
| Base Consumption (included) | 1,000 MTUs | 10,000 MTUs |
| Consumption (10k-25k MTUs) | n/a         | $0.012/month/MTU |
| Consumption (25k-100k MTUs) | n/a        | $0.011/month/MTU |
| Consumption (100k+ MTUs)     | n/a        | $0.010/month/MTU |
| Trial Period  | n/a           | 14 days       |

The usage-based component in Segment's pricing is related to **monthly tracked users (MTUs)**, namely the number of unique users whose data is stored on the platform each month.

## Get started

              "from_value": 20001,
              "flat_amount": "0",
              "per_unit_amount": "0.011"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

    2. [Assign the plan](/api-reference/subscriptions/assign-plan) to the customer
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ingest usage via events">
    Send usage events to Lago to track unique users with automatic deduplication.

    ```bash
    curl --location --request POST 'https://api.getlago.com/api/v1/events' \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer __API_KEY__' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data-raw '{
        "event": {
          "transaction_id": "{{$randomUUID}}",
          "code": "__BILLABLE_METRIC_CODE__",

          "properties": {
            "user_id": "user_id_001"
          }
