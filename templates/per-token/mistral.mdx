## Pricing structure
For Mistral, pricing depends on the language model used. Here are several price points they offer:
Prices are per 1M tokens used. You can think of tokens as pieces of words (learn more [here](https://mistral.ai/technology/#models))."

| Models          | Input                   | Output                  |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| mistral-small   | $1 / 1M tokens         | $3 / 1M tokens         |
| mistral-medium  | $2.7 / 1M tokens       | $8.1 / 1M tokens       |
| mistral-large   | $4 / 1M tokens         | $12 / 1M tokens        |

## Get started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a billable metric">
    Create a single billable metric to track token usage across different models and input/output types.
    
    Refer to the [API reference](/api-reference/billable-metrics/create) to create the billable metric object.

    1. Set the `aggregation_type` to `sum_agg`
    2. Set the `field_name` to `tokens`
    3. Set the `filters` to:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "key": "model",
        "values": [
          "mistral-small",
          "mistral-medium",
          "mistral-large"
        ]
      },
      {
        "key": "type",
        "values": ["input", "output"]
      }
    ]
    ```

    Refer to the [guide on filters](/guides/billable-metrics/filters) to learn more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a plan">
    Create a plan to price packages of tokens used.

    Refer to the [API reference](/api-reference/plans/create) to create the plan object.

    1. Set the `amount_cents` to `0` since there is no subscription fee
    2. Set the `charges` to:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "charge_model": "package",
        "filters": [
          {
            "invoice_display_name": "mistral-small-input",
            "properties": { // $1 per 1M input tokens
              "amount": "1",
              "free_units": 0,
              "package_size": 1000000
            },
            "values": {
              "model": ["mistral-small"],
              "type": ["input"]
            }
          },
          ... // Add more filters for other combinations
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```

    Refer to the [guide on charges with filters](/guide/plans/charges/charges-with-filters) to learn more.
  </Step>
    <Step title="Prepay usage with credits">
    Prepay usage with credits and set top-up rules in real-time.

    1. [Create a new customer](/api-reference/customers/create)
    2. [Create a new wallet](/api-reference/wallets/create) for the customer    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ingest usage via events">
    Send usage events to Lago to track usage.  

    ```bash
    curl --location --request POST 'https://api.getlago.com/api/v1/events' \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer __API_KEY__' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data-raw '{
        "event": {
          "transaction_id": "{{$randomUUID}}",
          "code": "YOUR_BILLABLE_METRIC_CODE",
          "external_customer_id": "YOUR_EXTERNAL_CUSTOMER_ID",
          "properties": {
            "tokens": 2000000,
            "model": "mistral-small",
            "type": "input"
          }
        }
      }'
    ```

    Refer to the [API reference](/api-reference/events/usage) to create an event.
  </Step>
