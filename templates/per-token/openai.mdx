In this article, you will learn how to build a billing system with Lago based on tokens.
This template is suitable for Large Language Model (LLM) and Generative AI companies whose pricing can vary based on the application or model used.

## Pricing structure
For OpenAI, pricing depends on the language model used. Here are several price points they offer:
*"Prices are per 1,000 tokens. You can think of tokens as pieces of words, where 1,000 tokens is about 750 words (learn more [here](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer))."*

| Model       | Input                | Output               |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 8K context  | $0.03 / 1,000 tokens | $0.06 / 1,000 tokens |
| 32K context | $0.06 / 1,000 tokens | $0.12 / 1,000 tokens |

## Get started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a billable metric">
    Create a single billable metric to track token usage across different models and input/output types.
    
    Refer to the [API reference](/api-reference/billable-metrics/create) to create the billable metric object.

    1. Set the `aggregation_type` to `sum_agg`
    2. Set the `field_name` to `total`
    3. Set the `filters` to:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "key": "model",
        "values": ["32k", "8k"]
      },
      {
        "key": "type",
        "values": ["input", "output"]
      }
    ]
    ```

    Refer to the [guide on filters](/guides/billable-metrics/filters) to learn more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a plan">
    Create a plan to price packages of tokens used.

    Refer to the [API reference](/api-reference/plans/create) to create the plan object.

    1. Set the `amount_cents` to `0` since there is no subscription fee
    2. Set the `charge_model` to `package`
    3. Set the `charges` to:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "charge_model": "package",
        "properties": {
          "amount": "0",
          "free_units": 0,
          "package_size": 1
        },
        "filters": [
          {
            "properties": { // $0.03 per 1,000 input tokens
              "amount": "0.03",
              "free_units": 0,
              "package_size": 1000
            },
            "values": {
              "model": ["8k"],
              "type": ["input"]
            }
          },
          ... // Add more filters for other combinations
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```

    Refer to the [guide on charges with filters](/guide/plans/charges/charges-with-filters) to learn more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ingest usage via events">
    Send usage events to Lago to track usage.  

    ```bash
    curl --location --request POST 'https://api.getlago.com/api/v1/events' \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer __API_KEY__' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data-raw '{
        "event": {
          "transaction_id": "{{$randomUUID}}",
          "code": "__BILLABLE_METRIC_CODE__",
          "external_customer_id": "__EXTERNAL_CUSTOMER_ID__",
          "properties": {
            "total": 5000,
            "model": "8k",
            "type": "input"
          }
        }
      }'
    ```

    Refer to the [API reference](/api-reference/events/usage) to create an event.
  </Step>
