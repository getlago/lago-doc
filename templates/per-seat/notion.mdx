Set up a per-user (or 'per-seat) pricing like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product), the collaboration software for innovative teams, including plans based on the number of users and prepaid credits.

In this template, you will learn how to build a 'fair' billing system, with charges calculated according to the number of days of use.

This template is suitable for companies whose pricing depends on persistent metrics, such as productivity software (e.g. number of days users are active), fintechs (e.g. number of days payment cards are active) and data platforms (e.g. number of days integrations are active).

## Pricing structure

Notion offers a Personal Pro plan for individuals who want to collaborate with friends or clients, and a Team plan through which members can set up a collaborative workspace. While the Personal Pro plan is limited to one member, the Team plan allows companies to invite as many members as they need.

| Model                    | Team plan                   |
| -----------------------  | --------------------------- |
| Price                    | $10 per user billed monthly |

## Get started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up Lago">
    <SetupLago />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a billable metric">
    Create a recurring billable metric to track user activity over time.

    1. Add a unique `code` for your billable metric
    2. Set the `aggregation_type` to `unique_count_agg` for counting unique users
    3. Set the `field_name` to `user_id` to identify individual users
    4. Set `recurring` to `true` for persistent tracking across billing periods

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash cURL highlight={7,9-11}
      curl --location --request POST "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/billable_metrics" \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer __API_KEY__' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-raw '{
          "billable_metric": {
            "name": "Active Users",
            "code": "__BILLABLE_METRIC_CODE__",
            "description": "Number of active users in the workspace",
            "aggregation_type": "unique_count_agg",
            "field_name": "user_id",
            "recurring": true
          }
        }'
      ```

      ```python Python highlight={5,7-9,12}
      from lago_python_client.models import BillableMetric

      billable_metric = BillableMetric(
        name='Active Users',
        code='__BILLABLE_METRIC_CODE__',
        description='Number of active users in the workspace',
        aggregation_type='unique_count_agg',
        field_name='user_id',
        recurring=True
      )

      client.billable_metrics.create(billable_metric)
      ```

      ```ruby Ruby highlight={3,5-7}
      client.billable_metrics.create({
        name: 'Active Users',
        code: '__BILLABLE_METRIC_CODE__',
        description: 'Number of active users in the workspace',
        aggregation_type: 'unique_count_agg',
        field_name: 'user_id',
        recurring: true
      })
      ```

      ```javascript JavaScript highlight={3,5-7,10}
      const billableMetric = {
        name: 'Active Users',
        code: '__BILLABLE_METRIC_CODE__',
        description: 'Number of active users in the workspace',
        aggregation_type: 'unique_count_agg',
        field_name: 'user_id',
        recurring: true
      };

      await client.billableMetrics.createBillableMetric({ billableMetric })
      ```

      ```go Go highlight={3,5-7,10}
      billableMetricInput := &lago.BillableMetricInput{
        Name:             "Active Users",
        Code:             "__BILLABLE_METRIC_CODE__",
        Description:      "Number of active users in the workspace",
        AggregationType:  "unique_count_agg",
        FieldName:        "user_id",
        Recurring:        true,
      }

      billableMetric, err := client.BillableMetric().Create(ctx, billableMetricInput)
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Refer to the [API reference](/api-reference/billable-metrics/create) and the [guide on recurring metrics](/guides/billable-metrics/recurring) to learn more.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a plan">
    Create a plan with prorated charges for fair per-seat billing.

    1. Set the `amount_cents` to `0` since there is no subscription fee
    2. Set the `charge_model` to `standard` for simple per-unit pricing
    3. Enable `prorated` billing for fair daily calculations
    4. Set the `amount` to `10` for $10 per user per month

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash cURL highlight={7,13-23}
      curl --location --request POST "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/plans" \

  <Step title="Create a customer">
    Create a customer with a unique `external_id`.

    <CreateCustomer />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a subscription">
    Create a subscription for the customer with the plan's `code`.

    <CreateSubscription />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ingest user activity events">
    Send usage events to Lago to track usage.  

    1. Reference your billable metric with `code`
    2. Reference the customer's subscription with `external_subscription_id`
    3. Include `user_id` in properties to track individual users
    4. Set `operation_type` to `add` when adding users, `remove` when removing
