In this article, you will learn how to offer free upfront credits for new users on a 'pay-as-you-go' pricing model. 
This template is fitted for infra companies, like this BigQuery example, but is also widely used among AI companies to let new users try their products easily. 
[Mistral](https://mistral.ai/news/2024-ft-hackathon/#:~:text=We%20offer%20%24100%20free%20credits%20to%20selected%20hackathon%20participants) or [Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs/pricing#:~:text=pplx%2Dapi%20implements%20a%20usage,of%20free%20credit%20every%20month) are other great examples.

## Pricing structure
BigQuery offers customers the possibility to subscribe for free and only pay based on usage. For new customers, the platform offers $300 worth of credits during 90 days to try the product completely for free.

| Plan      | Cost per volume of data scanned     |
|------------|------------|
| On-Demand pricing | $6.25 per TiB (a measure of compute capacity) |

## Get started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a billable metric">
    Create a billable metric to track data processing volume.
    
    Refer to the [API reference](/api-reference/billable-metrics/create) to create the billable metric object.

    1. Set the `aggregation_type` to `sum_agg`
    2. Set the `field_name` to `data_processed_volume`
    3. Set `recurring` to `false` for metered billing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a plan with graduated pricing">
    Create a plan with graduated pricing to include free tier usage.

    Refer to the [API reference](/api-reference/plans/create) to create the plan object.

    1. Set the `amount_cents` to `0` since there is no subscription fee
    3. Set the `charges` to:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "charge_model": "graduated",
        "properties": {
          "graduated_ranges": [
            {
              "from_value": 0,
              "to_value": 10000,
              "per_unit_amount": "0",
              "flat_amount": "0"
            },
            {
              "from_value": 10001,
              "to_value": null,
              "per_unit_amount": "6.25",
              "flat_amount": "0"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a wallet with free credits">
    “Start your 90-day free BigQuery trial which includes $300 worth of free usage”

    BigQuery lets new users try its product for free by offering upfront credits valid for 90 days. We can replicate this logic using Lago’s wallet feature and add prepaid free credits to it.

    1. [Create a new customer](/api-reference/customers/create)
    2. [Create a new wallet](/api-reference/wallets/create) with $300 of free credits
    3. Set `expiration_at` to 90 days from now for the trial period (ISO 8601 datetime format)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ingest usage via events">
    Send usage events to Lago to track data processing volume.

    ```bash
    curl --location --request POST 'https://api.getlago.com/api/v1/events' \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer __API_KEY__' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data-raw '{
        "event": {
          "transaction_id": "{{$randomUUID}}",
          "code": "data_processed",
          "external_customer_id": "YOUR_EXTERNAL_CUSTOMER_ID",
          "properties": {
            "data_processed_volume": 10
          }
        }
      }'
    ```

    Refer to the [API reference](/api-reference/events/usage) to create an event.
  </Step>
</Steps>
