## Activity Logs

  **Launch Week IV, Day 2: Billing Activity Logs**
  
  ❓'Who changed that price point?'

  ❓❓'Who created that plan?'
  
  ❓❓❓'What happened to this invoice?'

  We got you! That's why we are launching one of the most underrated but essential billing features: Activity Logs.

  Lago is used by engineering, finance, sales, and growth teams. Engineers build the billing engine, sales customize deals, finance reviews data—it can get messy. Activity logs bring clarity!

Every change is now logged. You’ll know who did what, when, and how—whether it came from the UI or API. We track the user or API key, the action, timestamps, resource IDs, and more. It is like git, but for your billing stack.

## Budget & Usage Alerts

  <Frame>
      <img src="/changelog/images/20250615-alerts.png" />
  </Frame>

  **Launch Week IV, Day 1: Budget & Usage Alerts!**
  
  We've all heard the horror stories of unsupervised AWS instances that lead to million-dollar invoices. Even when we're not talking about millions, you probably know the feeling of usage-based bills far more expensive than you thought.
  Lago now helps you prevent those scenarios. With budget & usage alerts,  you can put hard edges around consumption and billing. 

  The feature is basically a multi-layered warning system. You can track:
  1. **Lifetime spend** for the entire subscription—ideal for free trials that should never exceed, say, a total of $100.
  2. **Current-period spend** so finance knows when a customer hits 80 percent of this month's credits and engineering can act before overages accrue.
  3. **Metric-based spend** in amount or usage units, meaning you can send an alert when a user has used up 1 million API calls or $100 of API calls.

## Multiple billing entities within a Lago account!
  <Frame>
      <img src="/changelog/images/20250515-billing-entities.png" />
  </Frame>

  You can now manage multiple billing entities within a single Lago account.
  Whether you operate with different subsidiaries or invoice on behalf of third parties, this feature lets you issue invoices from multiple senders, different subsidiaries—without duplicating your setup.
  Your existing configuration (billable metrics, plans, settings, etc.) stays intact, making it easy to scale across entities while invoice settings (timezone, locale, grace period, etc.) can be configured differently.

  ## Know everything about prepaid credits consumption
  Our new prepaid credits dashboard is now live in beta! You can now track the flow of your prepaid credits, including the amount of credits offered, paid, consumed, and voided.

    <Frame>
        <img src="/changelog/images/20250422-invoice-idempotent-checkout-url.png" />
    </Frame>

    We made the payment URL generation idempotent to safely share with your end customers. 
    Each URL remains valid and unchanged for 24 hours, no matter how many times the endpoint is called — helping you prevent duplicate payments and simplify the checkout flow. 
    After 24 hours, a new URL will be generated on the next call, valid for the next 24-hour period.

  ## Failed payment nightmares are over: Lago payment pre-authorization

    Sick of launching a subscription, watching customers dive in all month, only to have payment fail at billing time—and then radio silence when you reach out? Failed charges not only leave revenue on the table but also create churn, frustrate customers, and bog your team down in manual follow-ups.

    With Lago's Payment Pre-Authorization, **you can now verify a card's validity and available funds when starting a subscription.** Catch bad payment methods upfront, automate notifications for declined pre-auths, and keep your service—and your revenue—flowing seamlessly. Enable it in your Lago dashboard today and turn payment nightmares into smooth, uninterrupted growth.

  ## Rescue failed wallet transactions!
    <Frame>
        <img src="/changelog/images/20250408-wallet-transaction-checkout-url.png" />
    </Frame>

    Payment intent failed? No worries — we've added a new endpoint that generates a payment URL for pending and failed wallet transactions. This feature allows your customers to complete their wallet top-ups through a secure checkout page, similar to how invoice payments work.
    A smoother recovery, a better experience. Dive into the docs for all the details!

  ## Track every cent: Payment Receipts are now available!
    <Frame>
        <img src="/changelog/images/20250407-receipt-document.png" />
    </Frame>

    <Info>✨ This feature is only available as an add-on. Please contact hello@getlago.com to get access to Payment Receipts.</Info>

    To give your customers better visibility into their payments, we've introduced **Payment Receipts** — a new PDF document and API payload generated by Lago. 
    Unlike invoices, these receipts provide a clearer breakdown of payments received, including the payment method used and any remaining balance. 
    This helps your customers track their transactions more easily and improves transparency around outstanding amounts.

    [Learn more](../guide/payments/receipts)
  
  ## Disable pdf generation
    <Frame>
        <img src="/changelog/images/20250324-pdf-no-generated.png" />
    </Frame>

    If you don’t rely on our PDFs, you can now configure Lago—via an environment variable—to skip PDF generation for invoices, credit notes, and receipts.
    Lago won’t process any jobs related to these documents, keeping your queues less crowded.

    [Learn more](../guide/self-hosted/docker#environment-variables)
    

  ## Invoice previews for upgrades and downgrades
    You can now preview invoices not just for new customers or dry runs on existing subscriptions, but also for upgrades, downgrades, and even plan terminations. 
    This means you have all the tools you need to estimate and preview invoices for every billing scenario. Get ready to take control of your billing like a pro!

  ## Enhanced wallet transaction details
    <Frame>
        <img src="/changelog/images/20250320-wallet-transaction-details.png" />
    </Frame>

    You can now view detailed information about a wallet transaction by simply clicking on it. 
    We’ve added comprehensive data to improve your understanding, including all relevant transaction details, linked payments, and associated invoices. 
    This update makes it easier to track and analyze your wallet transactions at a glance.

  ## Failed wallet transaction
    <Frame>
        <img src="/changelog/images/20250320-failed-wallet-transaction.png" />
    </Frame>

    We’ve introduced the `failed` wallet transaction! Now, when a wallet transaction is linked to a failed payment, its status will automatically update from `pending` to `failed`. 
    This enhancement provides a clearer view of the transaction lifecycle and simplifies debugging when needed.

  ## Expiration date for wallet recurring transaction rule
    <Frame>
      <img src="/changelog/images/20250313-expirat-at-recurring-transaction-rule.png" />
    </Frame>

    As part of our initiative to enhance the wallet experience, we’ve introduced two new settings for wallet recurring transaction rules.
    - You can now set an expiration date for a rule, and Lago will automatically terminate it once reached, preventing any further top-ups.
    - Additionally, you can define metadata for recurring top-ups directly through the Dashboard.

  ## Pay Lago invoices via Bank Transfers

      <Frame>
        <img src="/changelog/images/20250225-bank-transfers.png" />
      </Frame>

    Lago now supports Stripe’s bank transfers (customer_balance) for invoice payments. Supported methods:

    - JPY: Japan
    - GBP: United Kingdom
    - EUR: Specific SEPA countries (see Stripe documentation)
    - MXN: Mexico
    - USD: United States, United Kingdom, and select SEPA countries

  ## Custom SMTP Management
      
    By default, Lago automatically handles your SMTP configuration—no extra setup required. 
    
    However, if you prefer to use your own SMTP server, Enterprise customers can now send emails through a custom SMTP configuration.
                  
  ## Effortless Docker deployment in a single command
  We heard you—the old Docker commands were a bit of a hassle, so we've made things easier. Now, you can get the app up and running with just one simple command in your shell. Enjoy!

  ## To the moon: Crypto payments are now available
      <Frame>
        <img src="/changelog/images/20250220-crypto-payments.png" />
      </Frame>

    Lago now supports crypto payments! Don't worry though, your customers won't be paying you in a dog meme coin anytime soon. For now, we support USDC/USDP payments if you're using Lago with Stripe payments. 

    If you don't know, USDC is a stablecoin that's pegged to the US Dollar and always worth exactly $1, so it's not some speculative memecoin you're getting into. 

    Of course, you can turn this on and off as you like.

  ## Record payments and partial payments
      <Frame>
        <img src="/changelog/images/20250217-manual-payment.png" />
      </Frame>

    <Info>✨ This feature is only available via a premium license. Please contact hello@getlago.com to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.</Info>

    Some invoices aren't paid in full right away, or some of them are paid through bank transfers. This is true especially in bigger enterprise deals with unique payment terms. But this means that the invoice is neither unpaid nor paid — it's partially paid.

    You can now record these payments in Lago and easily find partially paid invoices at a glance by filtering. That way, you don't have to remember payments in your head, but always have an accurate overview directly in Lago. 


    [Learn more](../guide/payments/record-manual-payments)


  ## Partner billing & self-invoicing
      <Frame>
        <img src="/changelog/images/20250217-partner-billing.png" />
      </Frame>

    <Info>✨ This feature is only available via a premium license. Please contact hello@getlago.com to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.</Info>

    Many of our customers share some revenue with partners. If a partner gets them a new customer, the partner gets a cut of that revenue. 

    This is easy enough for subscriptions and tons of vendors enable this. But if you charged based on usage, you had to do it all manually because most billing systems couldn’t handle this. 

    We’re solving this now. Previously, you could only use Lago to invoice your customers. Now you can create partners. A partner invoice is addressed to you and comes from your partner, a concept we call self-billing.

    This means you can now manage partnerships directly within Lago instead of needing multiple tools. Lago will also calculate both the revenue this partner brings you and their overall cost.

    ## Back to the future with invoice previews
      <Frame>
        <img src="/changelog/images/20250217-invoice-previews.png" />
      </Frame>

    <Info>✨ This feature is only available via a premium license. Please contact hello@getlago.com to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.</Info>

    By using the `/invoices/preview` endpoint, you can generate a preview of an invoice for a potential purchase or to estimate the dry-run invoice of an active subscription. 
    This preview calculates the total invoice amount, itemizes each charge, and applies any relevant taxes or discounts. 
    By creating a preview, you can share the projected payment details without generating or finalizing an invoice.

    1. Prospective customers can now see exactly what they’ll have to pay if they buy the product. This gives them more clarity and makes them more likely to buy.
    2. As a company, you can now see what a customer’s invoice would look like if it was issued right now. This lets you a) support your customers better when they have.
    3. Your customers can preview what they’ll have to pay if they downgrade, upgrade, etc. in fine detail—including all taxes, credits, etc.

    </Frame>

    We’ve added a new endpoint to the wallet experience!
    No need to query the full wallet transaction list to view the details of a specific transaction—you can now retrieve a single wallet transaction directly with the new `GET /wallet_transactions/{lago_id}` endpoint.

  ## No need to leave Salesforce to apply coupons to accounts!
    We understand that sales teams prefer to stay within Salesforce as much as possible, so we’ve enhanced the Salesforce integration. 
    You can now select specific coupons and apply or remove them directly to or from your accounts in Salesforce—no need to switch to Lago.

    Users can now filter the list of credit notes (e.g. by currency, customer, issuing date, amount, reason, etc.) and the filtered list can then be exported from the user interface.

    Two export options are available:
    - Standard, including the list of credit notes and credit note amounts (i.e. one row per credit note); and
    - Advanced, including the list of credit note line items (i.e. one row per line item, so multiple rows per credit note if it includes multiple items).

    The list is automatically emailed to the requester in a CSV file.

    You can now customize permissions for API keys in Lago! 🔒

    When creating or editing an API key, you can define **read**, **write**, or **read and write** access for every object in the Lago API. This gives you full control over which endpoints can be accessed and how.

    If an API key doesn’t have the required permissions, the API will block the request, ensuring enhanced security and precise access control.

    For businesses billing on usage, keeping payments timely is essential. That's why we're introducing **Automatic Dunning**—a hands-off way to manage overdue invoices and keep cash flow steady.

    With Automatic Dunning, you can **set up tailored reminder campaigns** for different customer groups. Once activated, **these campaigns run on autopilot**, sending scheduled email reminders for any unpaid invoices. Reminders will keep going until the payment is made or you adjust the settings.

    Automatic Dunning keeps your payment reminders on autopilot, so you can focus on what matters while your billing engine handles collections in the background.

  ## Customizable rounding for usage metrics
    <Frame>
      <img src="/changelog/images/20241113-rounding.png" />
    </Frame>

    Previously, usage rounding in Lago was limited to a default precision. Now, with **Customizable Rounding Rules**, you have full control over how usage-based metrics are rounded.

    Choose from these rounding options:

    - **Ceil**: Always round up to the nearest integer.
    - **Floor**: Always round down to the nearest integer.
    - **Round**: Round to the nearest integer using standard rounding rules.

    Additionally, you can specify a **precision level**—positive or negative—allowing you to round usage to a set number of decimals.

    [Learn more](../guide/billable-metrics/rounding)


  ## Build any usage-based metric with SQL expressions
    Previously, usage-based metrics in Lago were powered by a single field—ideal for simplicity but limited in flexibility. Now, we are giving you complete control with SQL Expressions.

    **With SQL Expressions, you can build metrics tailored to your needs**. Use advanced math operations, concatenations, rounding, and more to create precise, custom metrics that reflect your unique usage patterns.

    **Custom expressions allow you to define more advanced computation logic** by dynamically using any event field within your expression. Here are a few examples:
    - **Concatenation:** `CONCAT(value1, '_', value2)`
    - **Math operations:** `((value1 * value2) / value3)`
    - **Rounding:** `ROUND(value1 / value2)`

    ```SQL SQL Expression example
    CEIL((event.properties.ended_at - event.timestamp) / 3600)

  ## Customer Portal complete rework
    <Frame>
      <img src="/changelog/images/20241031-customer-portal-rework.jpg" />
    </Frame>
    
    We’ve **completely reworked the Customer Portal**. You can now embed the portal URL to display in real-time **plans and usage information**, **wallet data**, **customer info**, and **invoice lists**.

    Additionally, your end customers can take actions directly within the portal, such as **adding prepaid credits** and **updating their customer info**—all automatically synced with your Lago back office.

    **Cherry on top?** We’re offering the new Customer Portal **for free** to all users, including those on our open-source plan.


  ## Usage ingestion sources
    <Frame>
      <img src="/changelog/images/20241031-ingest-usage-custom-sources.jpg" />
    </Frame>

    Premium ingestion sources for metering and usage consumption are now **generally available**. 
    Instead of using the basic API, you can leverage dedicated connectors to ingest data directly from sources like **AWS S3**, **AWS Kinesis**, **Kafka**, **MongoDB**, and **Azure**. 
    Most connectors support ingestion rates of **over 15,000 events per second** (compared to 1,000 via the basic REST API).

    For custom ingestion connectors, please contact the Lago team.

<Update label="September 2024">
 ## Anrok integration ✨
 <Info>✨ This feature is only available via a paying add-on. Please contact hello@getlago.com to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.</Info>

 We have developed an integration with Anrok to make tax management easier. This native integration allows you to automatically update your invoices with tax amounts sourced directly from Anrok.

 - Lago sends the customer's address, tax identifier (if applicable), and the relevant product ID to calculate the appropriate tax for each line item
 - Anrok calculates the tax for the invoice and returns the data to Lago, which is used to update the invoice with accurate tax information
 - Lago synchronizes updates for voided and disputed invoices, as well as any credit notes created, ensuring that your records remain up to date

 This integration ensures compliance with international tax regulations by calculating taxes for US & non-US obligations, like VAT.

 ## Precise amount for fees
 Lago now allows you to retrieve the precise (ie. non rounded) amount on the fee object. Before only the rounded `amount_cents` was available.

 To use the precise fee amount, you can use the `precise_amount` field.

 ## Progressive billing ✨
 <Info>✨ This feature is only available via a paying add-on. Please contact hello@getlago.com to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.</Info>

 Progressive billing, also known as threshold billing, automatically triggers an invoice when a customer's cumulative usage reaches predefined thresholds.

 This method ensures that customers cannot exceed certain usage limits without ensuring payment is received, reducing the risk of unpaid services or fraud.

 You can setup 2 types of threshold:
 - Step-based threshold: invoices are generated when the lifetime usage of a subscription reaches a defined threshold. You can set an unlimited number of thresholds, each with a specific amount and a unique name
 - Recurring threshold: this threshold determines what happens after the final step-based threshold is reached. (For example, after the last threshold, Lago will automatically bill $100 each time the lifetime usage increments by that amount)

 [Learn more](/guide/plans/progressive-billing#progressive-billing)

 ## Skip empty invoices generation
 Users can now decide whether or not to issue $0 invoices (ie. empty invoices). By default, empty invoices are generated. You can change this setting at the organisation level.

 When creating a customer, it takes by default the configuration of the organization for this specific field.

 However, you can decide to override this information for a specific customer. Why? You might have customers who need to receive an invoice each month, even if the total amount is 0.

 </Frame>

  ## Filter and export invoices
  Users can now filter the list of invoices (e.g. by currency, customer, issuing date, etc.) and the filtered list can then be exported from the user interface.

  Two export options are available:
  - Standard, including the list of invoices and invoice amounts (i.e. one row per invoice)
  - Advanced, including the list of fees (i.e. one row per fee, so multiple rows per invoice if the invoice includes multiple fees)

  The list is automatically emailed to the requester in a CSV file.

<Update label="August 2024">
 ## Invoicing options for wallet top-ups
 When creating a new wallet for a customer, users can choose to generate invoices for credit purchases either:
 - As soon as the wallet transaction is created
 - Only when payment is successful, which avoids generating invoices for transactions that have not been finalized

 These options are also available for automatic and manual top-ups (see `wallet_transaction.invoice_requires_successful_payment`).

</Update>



<Update label="July 2024">
 ## API changes (v1.7.0)
 As announced a few months ago, we have updated the event ingestion process and removed deprecated API fields. Changes include:

 **1. Replacing groups with filters**

 The new dimension system based on filters allows users to create billable metrics with more than two dimensions, and makes it easier to create charges based on custom event properties. The old dimension system based on groups has been permanently removed from the Lago API ([see all changes](/guide/migration/migration-to-v1.2.0#1-transition-from-group-to-filters)).

 **2. Marking `external­_subscription­_id` as mandatory for events**

 Events that only include `external­_customer­_id` are no longer taken into account when aggregating usage ([learn more](/guide/migration/migration-to-v1.2.0#2-mandatory-external-subscription-id-field-in-event-payloads)). This change will streamline the event validation process and enable real-time billing capabilities.

 **3. Removing deprecated API fields**

 For the sake of clarity and to preserve the quality of the API, we've deprecated several legacy fields ([see full list](/guide/migration/migration-to-v1.2.0#3-deprecated-fields)).

 </Frame>

 ## Hiding subscription fees at zero
 We have modified the invoice template and introduced new rules for subscription fees:
 - If `amount_cents` is zero for the subscription fee and there are no other fees (e.g. usage-based charges or commitment) in the invoice, the subscription fee will appear on the PDF invoice
 - If `amount_cents` is zero for the subscription fee and there are other fees in the invoice, the subscription fee will not be displayed on the PDF invoice

 ## Role-based access control (RBAC) ✨
 <Info>✨ This feature is only available to users with a premium license. Please contact hello@getlago.com to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.</Info>

 With the RBAC feature, organizations can ensure that each member only has access to the information and actions required to perform their job duties.

 There are three roles available on the Lago platform:
 - Admin: full access to all views and actions (usually assigned to billing engineers and managers)
 - Account Manager: can manage customer accounts and subscriptions (suitable for sales and success teams)
 - Finance & Analyst: mostly view-only, with the ability to manage invoices and credit notes

 ## Recurring wallet top-ups ✨
 <Info>✨ This feature is only available to users with a premium license. Please contact hello@getlago.com to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.</Info>

 Users can define rules to automatically trigger wallet top-ups, based on two methods:
 - Fixed: a predefined number of credits is added to the customer's wallet
 - Target: credits are added to the customer's wallet to reach a predefined balance

 There are also two trigger options:
 - Interval: weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly top-ups, with a custom start date
 - Threshold: the top-up is triggered when the ongoing balance of the wallet reaches a predefined minimum threshold

 ## Webhook messages for wallets
 Lago now sends webhook messages when:
 - A wallet transaction is created (see `wallet_transaction.created`)
 - The status of a wallet transaction is updated (e.g. when a pending transaction is settled - see `wallet_transaction.updated`)
 - When the ongoing balance of the wallet is zero or less than zero (see `wallet.depleted_ongoing_balance`)

 [Learn more](/api-reference/webhooks/messages#wallets)

 ## Void wallet credits

<Update label="April 2024">
 ## Filters for billable metrics
 We have made changes to our dimension system and replaced metric groups with filters. This new feature offers greater flexibility as:
 - Users can create as many filters as needed (they are no longer limited to two dimensions)

 ## Improved trial period
 When the subscription fee of a plan is paid in advance and the plan includes a trial period, the first invoice was initially generated when the subscription started. Following feedback from the Lago Community, we have modified this logic to generate the first invoice at the end of the free trial.

 [Learn more](/guide/plans/plan-model#the-trial-period-optional)

 ## Payment disputes
 If a payment dispute is reported as lost by the payment provider, Lago will provide `invoice.payment_dispute_lost_at` and send the webhook message `invoice.payment_dispute_lost`.

 This feature is available via integrations with Stripe and Adyen.

 <Frame>
   <img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63569f390f3a7ad4c76d2bd6/66254d35eec50942aebf62f4_disputes.png" />
 </Frame>

 ## Upcoming API changes (v1.2.0)
 We have released a new version of Lago with exciting new features, but also API changes likely to affect our users' workflows.

 **1. Replacing groups with filters**

 We have developed a new dimension system that offers greater flexibility. Filters allow users to create billable metrics with more than two dimensions, and make it easier to create charges based on custom event properties.

 However, this feature introduces changes to a number of objects, including `billable_metric`, `plan`, `fee` and `customer_usage`. In addition, the endpoint to retrieve billable metric groups will be deprecated ([see all changes](/guide/migration/migration-to-v1.2.0#1-transition-from-group-to-filters)).

 **2. The external subscription ID becomes mandatory for events**

 In order to develop real-time billing capabilities, we need to streamline our validation process. We have therefore decided to make `external_subscription_id` mandatory when sending events via the Lago API.

 Events that only include `external_customer_id` will no longer be taken into account when aggregating usage ([learn more](/guide/migration/migration-to-v1.2.0#2-mandatory-external-subscription-id-field-in-event-payloads)).

 **3. Deprecation of API fields**

 For the sake of clarity and to preserve the quality of the API, we are going to deprecate several legacy fields ([see full list](/guide/migration/migration-to-v1.2.0#3-deprecated-fields)).

 **Timeline**

 We will maintain the current API logic until July 9, 2024. After this date, previous versions will no longer be supported. We kindly ask our users to update their integration before that day to avoid any potential breaking change.

 [Learn more](/guide/migration/migration-to-v1.2.0)

 ## Minimum plan commitment ✨
 <Info>✨ This feature is only available to users with a premium license. Please contact hello@getlago.com to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.</Info>

 When creating a plan, defining a commitment ensures a minimum invoice amount for the billing period.

 This minimum is calculated at the end of the period, taking into account the subscription fee and all usage-based charges. If the total amount invoiced is less than the minimum commitment, Lago will automatically apply a true-up fee.

 The default commitment can be overridden when assigning the plan to a customer.

 </Frame>

 ## Grouping of charges
 It is possible to group charges on the invoice according to a custom attribute. When creating a charge based on the standard pricing model, users can define one or several `grouped_by` attributes that will then be used to provide information on the distribution of usage.

 For a customer who has sent thousands of API requests, for instance, we could display the breakdown of usage based on the `workspace_id` to which each request is linked.

 ## Edit draft invoices ✨
 <Info>✨ This feature is only available to users with a premium license. Please contact hello@getlago.com to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.</Info>

 When an invoice is in draft (i.e. during the grace period), fees can be modified via the user interface. Users can either:
 - Overwrite the total number of units, in which case Lago will automatically recalculate the fee based on the pricing model associated with the charge
 - Overwrite the number of units and unit price, in which case Lago will automatically recalculate the fee based on this information

 ## Batch endpoint
 Events can now be sent in batches using the new `/events/batch` endpoint. Each API call may include up to 100 events.

 [Learn more](/api-reference/events/batch)

 ## Disabling emails for invoices without fees
 To avoid sending too many notifications to customers, we have deactivated emails for invoices without fees.

 Although invoices with `"fees_amount_cents": 0` are no longer sent to customers by email, they are still available in the database and user interface.

 ## Integration with Salesforce CRM ✨
 <Info>✨ This feature is only available via a paying add-on. Please contact hello@getlago.com to get access to the Salesforce CRM integration.</Info>

 With the new Salesforce CRM integration, Lago data is automatically synced with Salesforce.

 Users can access their customers' subscriptions, invoices and credit notes directly in their CRM application.

 [Learn more](/integrations/crm/salesforce-crm)

 ## Removal of event validations
 We are currently upgrading our infrastructure and setting up a new event ingestion system. As part of this project, we have decided to remove the validations that were automatically performed when ingesting events through the Lago API.

 This means that the API no longer returns error messages when events include incorrect parameters (e.g. wrong billable metric code, subscription not found, `transaction_id` already exists, etc.).

 ## Retrieve a subscription
 We have added a new endpoint to allow users to retrieve a specific subscription via the Lago API, using the `external_id` of the subscription.

 [Learn more](/api-reference/subscriptions/get-specific)

 ## Webhooks for subscription upgrades/downgrades
 When the plan associated with a subscription changes, Lago automatically notifies the user with two webhook messages:
 - `subscription.terminated` to confirm the termination of the initial plan (includes `next_plan_code`)
 - `subscription.started` to confirm the start of the new plan (includes `previous_plan_code`)

 [Learn more](/api-reference/webhooks/messages)

  ## Plan details
 In the Plans section of the app, users can now click one of their plans to see its details (i.e. name, code, interval, currency, subscription fee, usage-based charges, etc.) and also retrieve the list of subscriptions linked to the plan.

 In addition, in the customer view of the app, users can click one of the subscriptions assigned to their customer to see its details (i.e. status, start date, interval, currency, fees, charges, etc.).

 ## Retrieve past usage
 We have added a new endpoint to retrieve past usage. When a billing period has ended, users can still retrieve usage data through `GET /customers/{external_customer_id}/past_usage`.

 Users must specify `external_subscription_id` and can filter results by `billable_metric_code`. They can also select the number of past periods for which they wish to retrieve usage data.

 [Learn more](/api-reference/customer-usage/get-past)
</Update>

<Update label="September 2023">
 ## LATEST aggregation
 `latest_agg` allows users to compute usage based on the last value received during the period for a billable metric.

 Consider the following example for the `storage` metric, where usage is aggregated based on the property `gb`:
 - The first event includes 5 GB
 - The second event includes 7 GB
 - The third event includes 6 GB

 With `latest_agg`, at the end of the billing period, the total number of units used to calculate the fee will be 6, as it's the last value received.

 </Frame>

 ## WEIGHTED SUM aggregation
 `weighted_sum_agg` allows users to compute usage based on a custom property and the time elapsed between two events (e.g. memory consumption measured in GB-seconds).

 Billable metrics based on this aggregation type can be metered or recurring, and are always billed at the end of the billing period.

 [Learn more](/guide/billable-metrics/aggregation-types/weighted-sum)

 ## Subscription end date
 When a subscription end date is set, the subscription is automatically terminated by Lago.

 A notification is sent to the user 45 days and 15 days before the subscription is terminated (see `subscription.termination_alert` webhook).

 If no end date is set for a subscription, it will renew automatically.

 [Learn more](/guide/subscriptions/assign-plan#subscription-end-date)

 ## Duplicate plans
 Users can duplicate an existing plan from the user interface to create a new plan with the same structure. They can then choose a name and a code for their new plan, and modify the parameters that differ from the original plan (e.g. interval, currency, charges, etc.).

 <Frame>

 ## Taxes applied to add-ons
 Tax objects can now be used to define the default tax rate(s) associated with an add-on.

 When creating a one-off invoice, if there is no tax rate associated with the add-on, Lago will automatically select the tax rate defined at customer or organization level.

 The tax rate applied to the add-on can be modified at any time through the user interface or the API.

 </Frame>

 ## Net payment term
  The net payment term determines the number of days given to the customer to pay their invoice. It is calculated based on the date the invoice is finalized and displayed on the PDF file.

  When the net payment term is defined at the organization level, it applies to all customers by default. However, it can be overridden by the net payment term defined at the customer level.

  </Frame>

  ## Taxes defined at plan and charge level
  In addition to the taxes defined at organization and customer level, users can select tax objects at plan and charge level.

  For subscription invoices, the tax hierarchy is as follows:
  1. Taxes defined at **organization level** will apply to all fees (i.e. subscription and charges)
  2. Taxes defined at **customer level** will take precedence over taxes defined at organization level and will apply to all fees (i.e. subscription and charges)
  3. Taxes defined at **plan level** will take precedence over taxes defined at customer level and will apply to all fees (i.e. subscription and charges)
  4. Taxes defined at **charge level** will take precedence over taxes defined at plan level but will only apply to the fee associated with the corresponding charge

</Update>

<Update label="July 2023">
 ## Filter subscriptions by status
 We have added a new query parameter to the endpoint that allows users to retrieve subscriptions.

 By default, `GET /api/v1/subscriptions/` returns all active subscriptions. However, you can also retrieve pending, canceled and terminated subscriptions by using the `status` parameter.

 [Learn more](/api-reference/subscriptions/get-all)

 ## SEPA Direct Debit with Stripe
 Our native integration with Stripe now supports SEPA Direct Debit payments.

 When Stripe is defined as the default payment provider for a customer, you can select the authorised payment method(s): card, direct debit or both.

 Before initiating a payment intent, Lago will automatically check the customer's default payment method registered in Stripe.

 Kindly note, SEPA Direct Debit is only available for invoices denominated in euros (EUR).

 [Learn more](/integrations/payments/stripe-integration#payment-methods)

 ## Recurring and prorated charges
 When a billable metric is defined as [recurring](/guide/plans/charges#metered-vs-recurring-charges), the number of billing units at the end of the billing period is carried over to the next period. It is not reset to zero, as with metered metrics.

 Users can create recurring metrics based on `sum_agg` and `count_unique_agg`. They can also define whether the corresponding charges should be [prorated](/guide/plans/charges#prorated-vs-fully-billed-charges) (this option is only available for the standard and volume pricing models).

 <Info>ℹ️ Metrics based on `recurring_count_agg` have been automatically converted into `count_unique_agg` metrics with the attribute `"recurring": true`.</Info>

 </Frame>

 ## Cancel pending subscriptions
  When a subscription is created with a subscription date in the future, its status is automatically set to `pending`.

  You can now cancel a pending subscription through the Lago API, using the following endpoint:
  `DELETE /api/v1/subscriptions/{external_id}?status=pending`

  [Learn more](/api-reference/subscriptions/terminate)

  ## Multiple webhook endpoints
  Webhook messages can be used to collect billing information and set up custom workflows. They are related to subscriptions, events, fees, invoices, payment providers and credit notes.

  You can now create up to five webhook endpoints to listen to Lago events.

  [Learn more](/guide/webhooks)

  ## Custom tax objects
 In the settings of their account, users can define the default tax rate that applies by default to all customers of their organization. This tax rate can then be overwritten at the customer level.

 Whether set at the organization level or the customer level, so far the tax rate used to calculate fees was simply indicated as "Tax" on invoices.

 To give users more flexibility, we've added the option to create several tax objects, which can then be assigned to the organization or specific customers (e.g. state sales tax, VAT, reverse charge, GST, etc.).

 [Learn more](/guide/invoicing/invoicing-settings/taxes)

 ## Stripe checkout URL
 When a new customer is successfully created through Lago's native integration with Stripe, the billing system sends a `customer.checkout_url_generated` webhook message.

 You can redirect your customer to the corresponding page to register their payment method, which will then be used to collect payment when a new invoice is issued.

 [Learn more](/integrations/payments/stripe-integration#stripe-checkout-storing-customers-payment-method-information)

 ## Tax identification number
 The [customer object](/api-reference/customers/object) and [organization object](/api-reference/organizations/organization-object) include a new `tax_identification_number` attribute. When a value is available for this attribute, it is automatically displayed on the PDF version of the next invoices.

  ## Integration with GoCardless
  Lago now offers native integration with [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com/), including (but not limited to):
  - Ability to define GoCardless as the default payment provider for a customer
  - Ability to automatically create Lago customers in GoCardless and retrieve their customer ID

  ## Payment retries
 We have added the ability to resend payments for collection.

 This new feature is available to all users:
 - Through the user interface ([learn more](/guide/payments/payment-retries))
 - Through the API ([learn more](/guide/payments/payment-retries))

  ## Grace period ✨
 <Info>✨ This feature is only available to users with a premium license. Please contact hello@getlago.com to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.</Info>

 If at the end of the billing period, you want to review the invoices before sending them to customers for payment, you can define a [grace period](/guide/invoicing/grace-period).

 During the grace period, invoices are in `draft` status and can be modified. Available actions include:
 - **Adding usage records** by sending events with a `timestamp` within the relevant billing period
 - **Applying coupons** to the customer's account
 - **Adding credits** to the customer's wallet and credit note wallet

 When the grace period expires, invoices are automatically `finalized` (they can no longer be edited), which triggers the `invoice.created` [webhook](/api-reference/webhooks/messages). You can also finalize invoices manually.

 The organization's grace period applies to all customers by default, but it can be overwritten by the customer's grace period.

 ## Invoice list
 We have added a new **Invoices** section, which allows you to access the list of invoices.

 Invoices are filtered according to their status (i.e. draft or finalized) and according to their payment status (i.e. succeeded, pending or failed).

 The same filters can be applied when [retrieving invoices via the API](/api-reference/invoices/get-all).

 </Frame>

   ## Credit notes ✨
 <Info>✨ Lago may automatically generate a credit note when a subscription is upgraded or downgraded. However, only users with a premium license can manually generate credit notes via the user interface or the API. Please contact hello@getlago.com to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.</Info>

 You can now use your Lago account to issue credit notes for subscription invoices and add-ons.

 Depending on the payment status of the invoice, you will be able to:
 - **Refund the customer** (only for paid invoices)
 - **Credit back the customer's account**

 Please refer to the [documentation](/guide/credit-notes) for more information on credit notes and credit methods.

 ## Timezones ✨
 <Info>✨ This feature is only available to users with a premium license. Please contact hello@getlago.com to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.</Info>

 You can now set the timezone of your organization in the settings of the app. To do so:
 1. Access the **Settings** section via the side menu
 2. In the **Organization** tab, you will see the current timezone (UTC by default)
 3. Click **Edit**
 4. Select a new timezone from the list
 5. Click **Save timezone** to confirm

 It can also be set through the API using this [endpoint](/api-reference/organizations/update).

 The organization's timezone applies to all customers by default and determines when billing periods start and end (i.e. when invoices should be generated). It is also the reference timezone for most views and lists in the app.

 The organization's timezone can be overwritten by the customer's timezone ([learn more](/guide/customers/invoice-customer#bill-following-your-customers-timezone)).

 <Info>ℹ️ In the app, you can hover over any date with a dotted underline to see the reference timezones.</Info>
</Update>

<Update label="December 2022">
 ## Lago Open API
 We have developed an Open API to help you get started with Lago and make it easier to test our solution.

 Please refer to the [documentation](/guide/lago-open-api) to learn how to import the Lago Open API into Postman and create a new collection.

 Our [public repository](https://github.com/getlago/lago-openapi) is also available on GitHub.
</Update>

<Update label="November 2022">
 ## Apply several coupons
 You can now apply several coupons to a customer account.

 When several coupons are applied to a customer, they will be deducted according to the date on which they were applied: the coupon that was applied first will be deducted first.

 The remaining value / number of remaining periods for each coupon will be visible in the **Overview** tab of the customer view.

 You can also use `GET /api/v1/applied_coupons` to retrieve all coupons applied to a customer.

## Invoice details
 To review the invoice details through the user interface:
 1. Go to the **Customers** section
 2. Select a customer to open the customer view
 3. Open the **Invoices** tab
 4. Click the invoice to see its details

 On the details page, you can download the invoice in PDF format and copy the invoice ID through the **Actions** dropdown in the upper right corner.

</Update>

<Update label="October 2022">
 ## Integration with GoCardless
 Lago now offers native integration with [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com/), including (but not limited to):
 - Ability to define GoCardless as the default payment provider for a customer
 - Ability to automatically create Lago customers in GoCardless and retrieve their customer ID
 - Ability to automatically collect payments via direct debit
 - Ability to automatically update the status of an invoice depending on the payment status
 - Ability to automatically resubmit failed payments with [GoCardless Success+](https://gocardless.com/solutions/success-plus/)

 To learn more about this integration, please [consult our guide](/integrations/payments/gocardless-integration).

  ## Subscription date
 It is now possible to set a start date in the past or in the future for a new subscription.

 Setting a start date in the past can be useful when migrating existing customers to Lago, while setting a start date in the future can be useful for scheduling upcoming subscriptions.

 For more information about the impact of the start date on the invoicing process, please refer to [the documentation](/guide/subscriptions/assign-plan#subscription-date).

  ## Dimensions for grouping events
 When creating a new billable metric, you can define dimensions that will be used to group events according to their properties.

 For example, if you want to charge your customers for compute capacity according to the cloud provider and server region, you can create a `compute` billable metric with two dimensions ([learn more](/guide/billable-metrics/filters)).

 Changes to the API include:
 - Ability to add a `group` parameter with one or two dimensions when [creating](/api-reference/billable-metrics/create) or [updating](/api-reference/billable-metrics/update) billable metrics
 - Ability to add a `group_properties` parameter when [creating](/api-reference/plans/create) or [updating](/api-reference/plans/update) a plan
 - Ability to retrieve [customer usage](/api-reference/customer-usage/customer-usage-object) by group
 - New `lago_group_id` for fees (see [invoice object](/api-reference/invoices/invoice-object))

## Enhanced coupon model
 We have improved the coupon model to offer more flexibility.

 Changes include (but are not limited to):
 1. Ability to define the value of a coupon as a fixed amount or percentage
 2. Ability to create recurring coupons that apply over several billing periods
 3. Ability to set an expiration date (i.e. date after which the coupon can no longer be redeemed)

 [Learn more](/guide/coupons)

## Customer currency
 It is now possible to define the currency at [customer](/api-reference/customers/object) level.

 The currency associated with each customer was previously defined by the currency of the plan assigned to the customer. This logic prevented users from assigning a coupon or an add-on to a customer before creating a subscription.

 When creating a new customer via the user interface or the API, you can now select the currency associated with the customer. If the currency is not defined at customer level, it will be determined by the first object assigned to the customer (i.e. currency of the plan, add-on, coupon, or wallet).

 <Info>⚠️ Once an object has been assigned to the customer (i.e. plan, add-on, coupon, or wallet), the currency associated with the customer cannot be changed.</Info>

 ## Error management
 We have refactored the error management system to give more visibility to API users.

 The `message` attribute for errors has been replaced with `code` and `error_details`, which provide more information about the errors. There are several codes associated with each error.

 For example, when creating a new billable metric, the API may return `"error": "Unprocessable entity"` with the code `value_is_mandatory` for the `name` field (i.e. the name of the billable metric is missing).

 Please refer to the [documentation](/api-reference/intro) available for each endpoint for more information on error codes.
</Update>


<Update label="September 2022">
 ## Invite members
 You can now invite your teammates to join your Lago account.

 To add a new member via the user interface:
 1. Go to the **Settings** section of the app
 2. Open the **Members** tab
 3. Click **Invite a member** on the right
 4. Enter the email address of your teammate
 5. Click **Generate invitation link** to confirm
 6. Copy the invitation link to share it with your teammate

 Invitation links have no expiration date. When your teammate clicks the link, they can choose their password and then access the account.

 You can remove a member by clicking the **bin icon** on the right of the list of members.

 <Info>ℹ️ All members have the same role and permissions.</Info>

 ## Overwrite plans
 If after a negotiation phase, you need to create a custom plan for an important customer, you can use the 'overwrite' feature, available through the user interface.

 This feature allows you to create a new plan from an existing one, in order to adjust the plan model and charges according to your business needs.

 Overwriting a plan has no impact on the original plan or existing subscriptions.

 [Learn more](/guide/subscriptions/assign-plan#overwriting-a-plan)

 ## Recurring count
 Companies with fair and transparent pricing models are often praised by customers. If you are considering implementing seat-based pricing for instance, the `reccuring_count` aggregation is exactly what you need.

 This new aggregation type allows you to push events for persistent units.

 Consider the following example:

 > Your customer is on a monthly plan and adds a new user to their account on September 15th, so you generate an event that corresponds to one billing unit.
 >
 > At the end of September, Lago will automatically create a prorated charge for this user, based on the number of days of activity (i.e. from September 15th to September 30th).
 >
 > This billing unit will remain valid until you generate another event to remove it. For instance, if your customer deletes the user on October 22nd, Lago will create another prorated charge for the period October 1st to October 22nd.

 Consult [our guide](/guide/billable-metrics/recurring-vs-metered) to learn more about persistent units.

 ## External IDs
 We are introducing changes to the API that will make it easier to manage subscriptions:
 - For the [creation of new subscriptions](/api-reference/subscriptions/assign-plan), `subscription_id` and `unique_id` will be removed and replaced with `external_id` (required)
 - For all other endpoints, `subscription_id` will be replaced with `external_subscription_id`

 This will allow you to operate via the API using your own identifiers and save you the trouble for storing our IDs.

 In addition to this, for consistency purposes:
 - For the [creation of new customers](/api-reference/customers/create), `customer_id` will be replaced with `external_id`
 - For all other endpoints, `customer_id will be replaced with `external_customer_id`

 These changes will come into effect on **September 8, 2022**.

 Please [get in touch](https://www.getlago.com/slack) with our team if you have any questions.
</Update>


<Update label="August 2022">
 ## Volume charge model
 The new volume charge model allows you to create a tiered pricing structure and then calculate a unit price that applies to all units depending on total volume.

 It is similar to the graduated charge model, except that only one price tier applies at the end of the billing period.

 Please refer to [the guide](/guide/plans/charges#charge-models) and [API documentation](/api-reference/plans/create) for more information.

 ## Anniversary dates for subscriptions
 When assigning a plan to a customer, you can now choose whether the subscription should be renewed at the beginning of the period or on its anniversary date.

 For instance, if a monthly plan is assigned to a customer on August 10th and you choose to align the billing cycle with the anniversary date of the subscription, the customer will be billed every 10th of the month.

 With [the API](/api-reference/subscriptions/assign-plan), you can use the `billing_time` attribute to choose your preferred option. If not provided, Lago will base the subscription on calendar periods.

 [Learn more](/guide/subscriptions/assign-plan#billing-cycles)

 ## Free units for the percentage charge model
 We have released an enhanced version of the percentage charge model, including:
 - Ability to define free units based on the number of events (e.g. first 3 events are free)
 - Ability to define free units based on the total amount (e.g. first $500 are free)

 Please refer to the [documentation](/guide/plans/charges#charge-models) for more information.

 ## Multiple plans
 It is now possible to assign multiple plans to a customer (e.g. if your customer needs to create several workspaces on your platform, you can link a plan to each workspace).

 To help differentiate each plan, you can add display names that will appear in the user interface and on invoices.

 Kindly note that:
 1. All plans must be denominated in the same currency
 2. You must now specify the `subscription_id` for each event or create batch events

 [Click here to see the documentation](/guide/subscriptions/assign-plan#multiple-plans)

 ## Tracking & Analytics
 To help us better understand your needs, we have added a tracking module to the self-hosted version of Lago.

 Data analytics will help us improve the quality of our product and performance of the API.

 As the privacy of our users is of paramount importance, we will not collect any personal information about your customers or the amount of your invoices, and you can opt out at any time.

 [Learn more](/guide/self-hosted/tracking-analytics)

 ## Go client
 We have added a new API client to make it easier for Go users to set up their billing system with Lago.

 ## PDF invoices
 Lago will generate a PDF file for each new invoice.

 You can download invoices via the user interface or the API and can also modify some of the elements included in the invoice template.

 Full documentation [available here](/guide/invoicing/download-invoices).

 ## New API endpoints
 We like our users when they use our nice and clean UI, but we also love when they use our API. One of the usecase could be to use Lago as a white-labeled solution.

 Here is the full list of endpoints we have just released:

 **Billable metrics**
 - Create a billable metric `POST /api/v1/billable_metrics`
 - Update a billable metric `PUT /api/v1/billable_metrics/:code`

 ## Integration with Stripe Payments
 Lago now offers native integration with Stripe, including (but not limited to):
 - Ability to create Lago customers in Stripe automatically and retrieve their customer ID
 - Ability to define Stripe as the default payment provider for a customer
 - Ability to generate payment intents automatically
 - Ability to update the status of an invoice depending on the payment status
 - Ability to receive a webhook when a payment fails

 To learn more about this integration, please [consult our guide](/integrations/payments/stripe-integration).

 ## Weekly plan interval
 When setting up a plan, you can select the weekly interval to define a weekly billing period.

 The plan interval applies to the subscription and charges, which means that:
 - For plans that must be paid in advance, the subscription fee is invoiced at the beginning of the week
 - For plans that are paid in arrears, the subscription fee is invoiced at the end of the week
 - Usage is calculated at the end of each week

 The week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday. If the customer's subscription starts in the middle of the week, the fees will be applied on a pro-rata basis.

  ## Invoice monthly charges for a plan paid yearly
 Before the release of this feature, usaged-based features (charges) were following the plan period. If the plan period was invoiced yearly, the charges were invoiced yearly.

 It's now possible to **invoice billable metrics on a montly basis** for a plan billed yearly. The base amount of the plan will be invoice yearly (in-arrears or in-advance), but your usage based features will be invoiced on a monthly basis.

 **To do so:**
 1. Access a **Plan**
 2. Define a plan **yearly**
 3. Price **additional charges** from your billable metrics
 4. Turn `on` the toggle for **applying charges monthly**

 By switching on, **all the charges** will be invoiced monthly even if the plan is yearly.

 <Info>ℹ️ The last invoice is gathering both the subscription and the usage-based charges</Info>

 ## Events list
 You are now able to view all the ingested events sent from your application to Lago. We called this feature `Events list` because it makes the event ingestion easier and more understandable.

 1. Access the `Developer` sidebar item
 2. Click the `Events` tab
 3. Take a look at the latest events ingested

 <Info>ℹ️ If an event you sent is not shown in the UI, it means that it has not been ingested by Lago</Info>

 This events list is also helpul to warn you for 2 specific cases:
 1. **Warning 1** - The event code is not related to an existing billable metric
 2. **Warning 2** - The property sent does not match the aggregation property defined in your billable metric

 ## Pay-as-you-go template
 We've added a new template to our collection: [click here](https://www.getlago.com/resources/templates/algolia) to learn how to replicate Algolia's pay-as-you-go pricing.

 It's a great starting point for companies whose pricing fully depends on usage, such as cloud service providers and API companies.

 With Lago, you can adapt this template to your products and services, using some of our most popular features, including the ['sum' aggregation type](/guide/billable-metrics/aggregation-types) and the [package charge model](/guide/plans/charges#charge-models).

  ## Coupons
 Introducing coupons, a new feature that allows you to offer discounts to your customers.

 Full documentation [available here](/guide/coupons).

</Update>


<Update label="May 2022">
 ## Subscription changes
 You can now modify the subscription assigned to a customer through the user interface.

 To learn how to upgrade or downgrade a subscription and how it affects billing, please refer to the documentation.

 ## Package pricing for charges
 It is now possible to apply a [package pricing model](/guide/plans/charges#charge-models) to a charge. To do so:
 1. Select an existing plan (or create a new one)
 2. Add a charge
 3. Select the package pricing model

 This new pricing model allows you to apply a flat fee to a range of units. The price will be fixed for the entire range, regardless of the number of units consumed by the customer during the billing period.

  ## Percentage charge model
 Inside the **plan**, when creating a charge, you can now select the **percentage charge model**.

 This feature is useful for industries willing to take a `% + fixed fee` out of a usage-based features (for banking or charity industry, for instance). These fees are applied on the *units to be charged* (e.g. the aggregation result of your billable metric).

</Update>
