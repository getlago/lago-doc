## 1. Is billing that hard for engineers?

Yes. Billing is indeed much harder for engineers than it might initially seem. Imagine you're starting a business, and you want to charge your customers for your products or services. At first, it seems pretty straightforward – you decide on a price, and customers pay you. But as your business grows, things get trickier. It's like managing a puzzle where the pieces keep changing. You have to deal with dates, handle plan upgrades, track usage, avoid charging twice, remind customers to pay, and navigate the tax maze (see more [here](https://www.getlago.com/blog/why-billing-systems-are-a-nightmare-for-engineers)).

For example, deciding how often to charge your customers for subscriptions and charges might sound simple, like choosing between weekly, monthly, or yearly billing. But it's more complex than it appears. You also need to factor in things like leap years, offering free trial periods, and deciding how to handle pro-rata pricing. And if you ever decide to switch from billing based on 'anniversary' dates to calendar dates, that adds even more complexity to the mix.

At Lago, we've adopted a radical approach – we're building an open source billing API for product-led SaaS. Our API and architecture are open, so that you can embed, fork and customize them as much as your pricing and internal processes require.

## 2. How is Lago different from Stripe? Can Lago replace it?

Lago is an open source metering and billing solution, whereas Stripe primarily focuses on payment processing. 

Stripe offers 21 products with separate fees (see more [here](https://www.getlago.com/blog/we-crunched-the-fees-of-stripes-21-products)), including Stripe Billing and Stripe Invoicing. 
Lago can replace Stripe for some services such as billing, invoicing and potentially [more](https://www.getlago.com/blog/calculating-stripe-mrr-is-difficult), but it does not process payments directly. Businesses using Lago will need a separate payment processor. Lago calculates how much you should charge a user and when, and sends this information to your chosen payment gateway(s) (Lago is agnostic) for the actual payment processing.

See detailed comparison of Stripe Billing vs. Lago [here](https://www.getlago.com/resources/compare/lago-vs-stripe).

## 3. Is Lago cheaper than Stripe?

Stripe Billing will cost you 0.5% (and up to 0.8%) of your transaction volume, on top of Stripe Payments (starts at 2.9% + $0.30 per successful card charge). With the full vendor lock-in of Stripe, you might stack dozens of fees that are directly impacting your own revenue. Once again, Stripe has 21 products and each of them has their own pricing (see more [here](https://www.getlago.com/blog/we-crunched-the-fees-of-stripes-21-products)).
Lago offers a forever-free open source solution for small businesses, allowing access to fundamental billing features. Besides, Lago provides Enterprise plans with access to premium features listed [here](https://www.getlago.com/pricing).

## 4. How is Lago different from Chargebee?

Chargebee is not designed for usage-based billing. Lago is.

Lago is designed for usage-based pricing models, providing a high level of flexibility and support complex usage-based scenarios. Chargebee supports standard usage-based models (e.g. $20 per user) but may not be flexible enough for businesses that need support for complex usage-based pricing models (e.g., PayPal's per-transaction pricing). Chargebee limits the maximum number of usages that can be recorded for a subscription is 5,000, over its lifetime. 

Lago has no rate limit for usage-based billing events, allowing for high volume processing. Chargebee has a rate limit of 100 simultaneous requests per minute, which could prevent you from sending granular usage when you start scaling your number of customers. 
Additionally, Lago, being an open source solution, offers complete transparency, allowing engineers to audit its code and even build on top of it, which Chargebee does not allow.

## 5. Is Lago cheaper than Chargebee?
