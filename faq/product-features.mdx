Yes. Prepaid credits are a great way to give customers better spend visibility and facilitate payment collection in advance.

To prepay for usage with lago follow this simple steps:
1. Create a new wallet for prepaid credits;
2. Assign a value for each credit (eg. 1 credit equals 1$);
3. Specify the number of credits to purchase; and
4. Configure recurring top-up rules based on real-time consumption (threshold or interval top-ups)

See a real-life example of prepaid credits with Mistral [here](/templates/per-token/mistral).
