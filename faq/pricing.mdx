## 1. Is Lago free?

Lago offers a forever-free open source solution offering access to fundamental billing features. Besides, Lago also offers paying plans with access to premium features listed [here](https://www.getlago.com/pricing).

## 2. How is your pricing structured?

Our pricing is structured in packages that are tailored to specific company stages: early, scaling, or more on the enterprise side. 

We’re willing to grow with our customers sustainably (if they are successful, we are successful too) so we have included a usage-based dimension (e.g., number of events ingested, invoices generated, or active customers) in our packages 

Contact us at hello@getlago.com to discuss what features and usage volumes work best for your company.

## 3. Can I self-host the Premium features?

Yes. Lago offers Enterprise plans with access to premium features listed [here](https://www.getlago.com/pricing). You have the flexibility to choose between cloud hosting or self-hosting options. 

Please reach out via [Slack](https://lago-community.slack.com/ssb/redirect) or hello@getlago.com for further details.

## 4. Can I have a free trial for Lago Premium? 

You can use and/or try Lago forever-free product by downloading our self-hosted and open source product [here](https://doc.getlago.com/guide/introduction/welcome-to-lago). We unfortunately do not offer free trials for our premium plans (cloud or self-hosted).
