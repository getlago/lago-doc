However, **Lago is not a payment service provider (PSP)**.

To collect payments from your customers, you can:

1. Use our native integrations with
   [GoCardless](/docs/guide/payments/gocardless-integration) and
   [Stripe Payments](/docs/guide/payments/stripe-integration); or
2. Use the [webhooks](/docs/api/webhooks/messages) sent by Lago to transmit
   billing information to your PSP (e.g. Paddle, Adyen, internal ledger, etc.).

Lago is **agnostic**, which means that you can use our billing solution with any
PSP.
