  "Lago's native integration with Stripe allows you to collect payments
  automatically when new invoices are generated."

## Integration setup[](#integration-setup "Direct link to heading")

To set up the integration with Stripe through the user interface:

1. In the side menu, select **"Settings"**;
2. Select the **"Integrations"** tab;
3. Click **"Stripe"** and enter your Stripe API key
   ([locate your API key](https://support.stripe.com/questions/locate-api-keys-in-the-dashboard));
   and
4. Click **"Connect to Stripe"** to confirm.

<Info>
  By default, customers created in Lago are not automatically created in Stripe.
  If you want your Lago customers to be added to Stripe, you need to activate
  this option ([learn more](#new-customer)).
</Info>

## Customer information[](#customer-information "Direct link to heading")

To collect payments automatically, the customer must exist in both the Lago and
Stripe databases.

### New customer[](#new-customer "Direct link to heading")

If the customer does not already exist in Stripe, you can first create them in
Lago, either via the user interface or [the API](/api/customers/create-update).
When adding customer information, you must:

1. Define Stripe as the **default payment provider**;
2. Leave the field associated with the **Stripe customer ID** blank; and
3. **Enable** the option to automatically create the customer in Stripe.

The customer will automatically be added to Stripe. Stripe will then return the
customer ID, which will be stored in Lago.

### Existing customer[](#existing-customer "Direct link to heading")

If the customer already exists in Stripe but not in Lago, you should create the
customer record, either via the user interface or
[the API](/api/customers/create-update-customer). When adding customer
information, you must:

1. Define Stripe as the **default payment provider**;
2. Provide the **Stripe customer ID**; and
3. **Disable** the option to automatically create the customer in Stripe.

## Payment intents[](#payment-intents "Direct link to heading")

Once Stripe is connected and the customer exists in both databases, you can
start collecting payments.

Each time a new invoice with an **amount greater than zero** is generated by
Lago, a payment intent will automatically be created. Stripe will record the
invoice ID and process the payment. If the payment is successful, the status of
the payment will switch from `pending` to `succeeded`.

If the payment fails, the status of the payment will switch from `pending` to
`failed` and Lago will generate an `invoice.payment_failure`
[webhook](/api/webhooks/messages).

<Warning>
  A valid payment method for the customer must be defined in Stripe for the
  payment intent to succeed ([learn how to save payment
  details](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/save-and-reuse)).
</Warning>
