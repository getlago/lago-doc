title: "Errors"

The Lago API uses standard HTTP response codes to clearly indicate the result of each API request:

- **2xx**: Success - The request was processed successfully.
- **4xx**: Client Error - There was an issue with the request, such as missing parameters, invalid input, or unauthorized access.
- **5xx**: Server Error - An error occurred on Lago's side while processing the request.

For some 4xx errors, the response body will include additional information to help you understand and resolve the specific problem.
