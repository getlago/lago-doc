title: "Delete billable metrics"
---

You may delete a billable metric linked to [charges](/docs/guide/plans/charges)
associated with existing [subscriptions](/docs/guide/plans/subscription).

If you do so:

- The events associated with this billable metric, which are assigned to the
  current billing period or linked to `draft` invoices, will be immediately
  deleted;
- The charges associated with this billable metric will be immediately removed
  from all plans and existing subscriptions;
- The charges associated with this billable metric will no longer be included in
  the [current usage](/docs/api/customer%5Fusage/customer-usage-object) of the
  customers concerned; and
- The charges associated with this billable metric will be immediately removed
  from all `draft` invoices linked to these subscriptions.

However, the charges associated with this billable metric will still be included
in all `finalized` invoices linked to these subscriptions.

<Info>
  After deleting a billable metric, you can create a new one using the same
  code. However, past events will not be linked to this new billable metric.
