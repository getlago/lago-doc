  "Lago automatically generates invoices for each customer according to the plan
  model."
---

When a new invoice is generated, Lago also sends an `invoice.created` webhook
([learn more](/api/webhooks/messages)).

When an invoice is linked to an add-on, another type of webhook is sent, called
`invoice.add_on_added`.

## Invoice object[](#invoice-object "Direct link to heading")

Invoices include (but are not limited to):

- Invoice number;
- Billing period;
- Customer information;
- Fees; and
- Taxes.

You can [download invoices](/invoicing/download-invoices) or use the
[invoice object](/api/invoices/invoice-object) to create your own invoice
template.

<Tip>
  You can also use the invoice object to transmit information to your accounting
  software or payment service provider.
